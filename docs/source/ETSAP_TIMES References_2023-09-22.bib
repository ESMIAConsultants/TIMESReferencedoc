abstract = {Urban energy system modelling allows megacities to assess their future development and to draw sustainable pathways to meet the rapidly increasing energy needs. This paper elaborates three different scenarios for energy transition in Greater Cairo with particular emphasis on the impact of lowering the share of inhabitants living in informal settlements. A city-specific TIMES energy system model is used to investigate how energy supply and demand will evolve between 2015 and 2050. Besides, the impacts in final energy consumption and CO2 emissions are investigated considering different socio-economic pathways. The scenarios show that the long-term cost-efficiency optimization leads to the decarbonization of the power sector even in the absence of climate constraints. Climate policies are modeled to achieve by 2050 a carbon emissions reduction of 50% below the 2015 baseline. The results indicate that the implementation of current urban plans will double the carbon emissions per capita if no mitigation policies are adopted. The urban expansion programs need to take into consideration the energy-environment-economic nexus and to be coupled with climate mitigation policies to contain the rising carbon emissions.},

abstract = {In Indonesia, energy consumption (excluding non-commercial energy) increased from 328 MBOE in 1990 to 478 MBOE in 1995. As a consequence, energy sector CO2 emissions increased from 150 million tons to over 200 million tons during the same period. The present rapid economic growth Indonesia is experiencing (7-8%) will continue in the future. Based on a BAU scenario, primary energy supply for the year 2020 will be 18,551 PJ, an increase of 5.9% annually from 1990 CO2 from the energy system will increase from 150 Teragrams in 1990 to 1264 Teragram in 2020. The mitigation scenario would reduce total CO2 emissions from the BAU scenario by 10% for the year 2000 and 20% by 2020. Some demand side management and energy conservation programs are already included in the BAU scenario. In the mitigation scenario, these programs are expanded, leading to lower final energy demand in the industrial and residential sectors. Indonesia's total primary energy supply in 2020 is approximately 5% lower for the mitigation scenario than for the BAU scenario. In the BAU scenario, coal and oil have the same contribution (25%). In the mitigation scenario, natural gas and nonfossil fuels such as hydropower, geothermal, and nuclear have higher contributions. {\textcopyright} 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The analyses are based on a long-term energy system model of Bangladesh using the MARKAL framework. The analysis shows that Bangladesh will not be able to meet the future energy demand without importing energy. However, alternative policies on CO2 emission constraints reduce the burden of imported fuel, improve energy security and reduce environmental impacts. The results show that the introduction of the CO2 emission reduction targets and carbon taxes directly affect the shift of technologies from high carbon content fossil-based to low carbon content fossil-based and clean renewable energy-based technologies compared to the base scenario. With the cumulative CO2 emission reduction target of 10-20% and carbon tax of 2500Taka/ton, the cumulative net energy imports during 2005-2035 would be reduced in the range of 39-65% and 37%, respectively, compared to the base scenario emission level. The total primary energy requirement would be reduced in the range of 4.5-22.3% in the CO2 emission reduction targets and carbon tax 2500Taka/ton scenarios and the primary energy supply system would be diversified compared to the base scenario. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Defining a roadmap to achieving low carbon targets and explaining these targets in quantitative form as much as possible is known as backcasting. Plenty of computer-based quantitative models and tools are used to outline low carbon society scenarios in the Asia-Pacific region and implementations of such models are underway. This paper spotlights these quantitative models and tools which are used to achieve backcasting benchmarks. These models are critically reviewed for their functioning and real possibilities on ground levels and suggestions have been made to improve practical implementation in developing Asia. The study found that all these models are highly acceptable and applicable in Asian countries but actual applications are rare, with Japan as the leading country in implementing such applications, followed by Malaysia. Estimation of CO 2 sinks, open availability, and energy service demands (built-in option) are major weaknesses of the models. We also concluded that these computer-based quantitative models are helpful for almost all of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region facing such issues as data limitation, fewer resources, and lack of government participation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Long-term energy planning models and dispatch simulations are two key stages in the methodology for a cost-effective transition to a low-carbon power system. Although these stages are equally important, they are often performed independently. This decoupled approach can lead to future investment trajectories decided by long-term energy planning models with no guarantee of a reliable electricity supply. To tackle this problem, the aim of this study was to develop a general methodological framework using a multi-model approach to address adequacy requirements in the long term. An automated soft-linking model was used to successively: i. Plan the optimal power generation mix to satisfy a given level of future expected electricity demand subject to various constraints using the TIMES framework (The Integrated MARKAL–EFOM System). ii. Assess the adequacy of the obtained power generation mix under several climatic and operational future states using the probabilistic operational open-source model ANTARES (A New Tool for the generation Adequacy Reporting of Electric Systems). iii. Implement iterative feedback loops based on the estimated ability of different generating technologies to support peak demand (capacity credit) to ensure a total firm capacity in line with the electricity supply criterion.This methodology was applied to a case study of power generation planning in France for the period 2013–2050. The results show that using TIMES alone provides a power generation mix for 2030 that risks insufficient supply levels. On the other hand, activating iterative feedback loops over capacity-credit exogenous parameters has the potential to ensure both the economic effectiveness of the mix and the security of the electricity supply criterion set by the French public authorities.},

Since interconnection with neighbouring Spain may be one of the key drivers to achieve a cost-effective low carbon pathway, combined with new generating technologies, we evaluate its importance by modelling the Portuguese system either as an isolated or as part of an integrated Iberian system. To design the low carbon roadmap for 2050 in Portugal, TIMES - The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM (MARKet ALlocation-Energy Flow Optimisation Model) System was used. It is an optimization partial equilibrium bottom-up model generator that finds the minimal cost solution for an energy system over a certain time period. Our approach accounts for the short term dynamics of supply and demand to enable a better match and optimize resources complementarities. The results show that modelling Portugal as an isolated system can lead to underinvestment and underuse of the country's endowment of renewable energy sources in the longer term, which reduces the efficiency of investment. The modelling of Portugal as an interconnected energy system can therefore have a significant impact on the design of a sustainable electricity system and lead to improved investment efficiency with lower costs risk. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Its main goal (as a first step) is to show the relevance of using a highly detailed spatial and temporal modeling tool of the Portuguese electricity system in order to be able to adequately capture climate variability in the planning of the system up to 2050. To do so, we consider seasonal and intraday hydro, wind and solar resources variability in a large TIMES energy system model, in the eTIMES_PT model. Existing hydro, wind and thermal powerplants are modelled individually, whereas new plants are modelled at municipality level. The importance of introducing climate variability is assessed by modeling six scenarios: a reference case and both “humid” and “dry” hydropower scenarios. Each of these is also modelled with CO2 emissions cap by 2050. Results show that hydropower electricity generation variations are within range of those referred in literature by other authors. However, in this work, we are able to capture higher variations within seasons and time of day. Also, the analysis enables to account for the combined variability of hydro, PV and wind resources. This variability will subsequently consider data from seasonal forecasts and climate projections.},

abstract = {Despite an emerging consensus that societal energy consumption and related emissions are not only influenced by technical efficiency but also by lifestyles and socio-cultural factors, few attempts have been made to operationalise these insights in models of energy demand. This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use, the environment and well-being. The 'what if' Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case. Despite the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles and the larger share of electricity in final energy demand, it shows a future where electricity decarbonisation could be delayed. The paper illustrates the key trade-off between the more aggressive pursuit of purely technological fixes and demand reduction in the transport sector and concludes there are strong arguments for pursuing both demand and supply side solutions in the pursuit of emissions reduction and energy security. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Both of these scenarios are modelled with and without climate policy by restricting cumulative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The analysis focusses on implications on China's primary energy production and consumption, primary energy trade, generation mix and final energy consumptions. Estimates of global recoverable gas resources have increased sharply in the recent decade, predominantly as a result of technological advances unlocking gas resources in unconventional reservoirs, such as tight sands, coal bed methane, and, most importantly, shale rock. Although at present, unconventional gas predominantly plays a significant role only in United States, it has the potential to reduce supply, price volatility, and energy security concerns for a number of regions globally, as lessons learned in the United States are applied internationally.},

abstract = {Both fuel cell and electric vehicles have the potential to play a major role in a transformation towards a low carbon transport system that meets travel demands in a cleaner and more efficient way if hydrogen and electricity was produced in a sustainable manner. Cost reductions are central to this challenge, since these technologies are currently too expensive to compete with conventional vehicles based on fossil fuels. One important mechanism through which technology costs fall is learning-by-doing, the process by which cumulative global deployment leads to cost reduction. This paper develops long-term scenarios by implementing global technology learning endogenously in the TIAM-UCL global energy system model to analyse the role of hydrogen and electricity to decarbonise the transport sector. The analysis uses a multi-cluster global technology learning approach where key components (fuel cell, electric battery and electric drive train), to which learning is applied, are shared across different vehicle technologies such as hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and battery operated vehicles in cars, light goods vehicles and buses. The analysis shows that hydrogen and electricity can play a critical role to decarbonise the transport sector. They emerge as complementary transport fuels, rather than as strict competitors, in the short and medium term, with both deployed as fuels in all scenarios. However, in the very long-term when the transport sector has been almost completely decarbonised, technology competition between hydrogen and electricity does arise, in the sense that scenarios using more hydrogen in the transport sector use less electricity and vice versa.},

A second key UK energy policy is to increase the share of final energy consumption from renewables sources to 15% by 2020, as part of the wider EU Renewable Directive. The UK's principle mechanisms to meet this renewable target are the Renewable Obligation (RO) in the electricity sector, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), and most recently the Renewable Heat Programme (RHP) for buildings. This study quantifies a range of policies, energy pathways, and sectoral trade-offs when combining mid- and long-term UK renewables and CO2 reduction policies. Stringent renewable policies are the binding constraints through 2020. Furthermore, the interactions between RO, RTFO, and RHP policies drive trade-offs between low carbon electricity, bio-fuels, high efficiency natural gas, and demand reductions as well as resulting 2020 welfare costs.

abstract = {The EU's Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) sets a binding target for energy-savings in EU member states. The EED further requires member states to perform ex-ante evaluations of energy efficiency policies implemented to achieve these savings. However, ex-ante evaluation of energy efficiency policies is difficult as it requires detailed modelling of end-users' investment and energy demand behaviour. This paper details the Danish IntERACT modelling approach for ex-ante evaluation of energy efficiency policies directed at residential heating. IntERACT integrates the energy system model TIMES-DK into a computable general equilibrium framework. The paper explores the potential for meeting Denmark's EED-target through a policy-induced increase in households' investments in energy efficiency retrofits. The paper considers the effect of energy efficiency policies on households' investment behaviour by applying different levels of hurdle rates on households' investments in energy efficiency retrofits. The paper shows that reducing the hurdle rate from 25% to 4% could meet more than a third of Danish energy-saving requirements for the period 2021–2030. This result includes a direct rebound effect of 31%. Finally, the paper demonstrates that reducing the hurdle below 10% has a substantial negative impact on households' disposable income, making such policy less viable from a policy perspective.},

abstract = {Limiting the rise in global temperatures requires the rapid, and massive deployment of solutions to reduce carbon emissions at all levels. The development of intermittent renewable energy resources has received significant support from governments, and its production will considerably increase. The introduction of this high electrical production presents some challenges, in particular, the allocation of high production in low consumption periods. One of the most promoted solutions to cope with this challenge is the integration of power-to-gas technologies (P2G). In this area, the European Union and some of its members have presented plans supporting the production and consumption of hydrogen. At the same time, it should be noted that the development strategies for these technologies are largely deployed at the local level. To allow local territories to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy system, national governments are extending the application of their energy policy to local areas. This is the case in France, which over the last decades has adopted laws to extend the application of its energy policy at local level, with the objective of ensuring better, faster deployment of its energy transition and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. As a result, the French regions have targeted objectives for the development of their local energy resources. The SUD Provence-Alpes-C{\^{o}}te d'Azur Region (PACA) in southern France, in response to these air, energy, environment, and climate change adaptation responsibilities, has set a target to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This will involve the massive development of solar photovoltaic production as the region has considerable access to solar resources. The region has also presented a hydrogen plan to support the development of this energy in the region and contribute to national efforts. This study, conducted with TIMESPACA a bottom-up optimization model representing the energy system of the PACA region, analyzes how P2G technologies contribute to the development of solar resources. Results show that P2G technologies are essential for the decarbonization of the regional energy system and the deployment of renewables, that they are required to reach national and global decarbonization objectives, and that they are expected to structure the whole hydrogen chain.},

abstract = {This article presents the long-term techno-economic prospective model ETEM-AR that aims to help decision-makers to analyze the future of the energy mix and energy use at a regional level in the context of climate change. The model incorporates a description of the two potential paths one may choose to follow when confronting the impacts of climate change: mitigation and adaptation, together with the corresponding technologies. The inherent uncertainties in the evaluation of the importance of climate change and of its consequences on the energy sector are treated via stochastic programming and robust optimization. A set of contrasted scenarios is used to describe the possible future consequences of climate change on key parameters of the energy system, such as the reduction of the efficiency of some of the technologies. By comparing the results emerging from the stochastic analysis performed with these scenarios with the analysis of deterministic scenarios, one can understand the necessity, or the absence of it, of investing in certain adaptation technologies prior to the unfolding of the considered uncertainties. The robust optimization techniques are used to ensure the optimal strategy remains a good strategy if some parameters vary in a given interval. The main effect of using a robust analysis is the emergence of a diversification of the technology choices. The model, ETEM-AR, is illustrated here through its application to the French region of Midi-Pyr{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}es.},

The approach is designed to simultaneously address the shortcomings and maintain the attractive features of detailed energy sector and general equilibrium models. It also reflects common country-level energy planning processes. We illustrate the capabilities of this integrated bottom-up approach by analyzing the implications of (i) a carbon tax, (ii) liberalization of import supply restrictions in order to exploit regional hydropower potential, and (iii) a combined policy where both carbon taxes and import liberalization are pursued. For the combined scenario, our results suggest substantial emissions reductions relative to Baseline at essentially no cost to economic growth but about a one percent reduction in employment. We conclude that a regional energy strategy, anchored in hydropower, represents a potentially inexpensive approach to decarbonizing the South African economy. The strategy also has political economy attractions in that the combined approach reduces the burden of adjustment of politically sensitive sectors.},

abstract = {Higher spatial resolution is becoming a key component of energy system analysis. Existing multi-regional national scale energy systems optimisation models (ESOMs) facilitate an improved understanding of spatial dynamics. Yet, region-specific characteristics of transport technologies and infrastructures along with consumer heterogeneity have remained under-investigated. The current paper addresses this gap by developing a multi-regional transport sector within the system-wide TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM). The transport sector is divided into 26 sub-regions, and each region is characterised by the existing vehicle fleet, public transport availability, scrappage rate, annual mileage, vehicle fuel economy and the corresponding passenger and freight mobility demand. The consumers (car buyers) are disaggregated based on their income level to incorporate a more realistic representation of their behaviour in vehicle purchasing decisions. While TIM ensures carbon neutrality across the whole energy system by mid-century, this study mainly explores the decarbonisation of passenger Light-Duty Vehicles (LDVs). It shows to what extent different measures (i.e, LDV improvements, monetary incentives, modal shift, biofuel obligation, carbon tax and occupancy rate) can contribute to meeting ambitious mitigation targets by 2030. Spatially resolved analysis as the main novelty of this research presents valuable insights into regional electric vehicles (EVs) diffusion and their electricity consumption. The proposed method can be used to address the uncertainty that arises from consumer heterogeneity in the policymaking process. The findings also suggest keeping financial EV incentives until the mid-2020s to meet the ambitious goals. Finally, decarbonisation without demand-side strategies (i.e., controlling the level of private-car-based mobility) seems to be unachievable.},

When analyzing national policies, the findings of worldwide analyses are of limited accuracy and the large aggregates on which they are built level out most local specificities and inertia. Specific assessments are hence needed. This paper quantifies the dynamic evolution of carbon values for French climate and energy policy. Its time dependency over successive periods and the effects of setting intermediate targets are evaluated using a long-term optimization model. Addressing critical issues for France, we produce consistent energy, emissions and carbon value estimates with a 5-year time step. Our results are situated above the upper range of carbon value estimates of world models with an overlapping zone. We show that the official policy guideline value is only consistent with an optimistic combination of assumptions. The central estimates are 4 times greater than the guideline carbon value for 2050 and up to 14 times greater in 2020 because of short-term inertia that are costly to move. We also find that with intermediate objectives, the carbon value's dynamic is more than a simple upward curve and that its variability is itself time dependent. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The transition to low carbon societies may increase peak electricity demand, which can be costly to supply with renewable energy, whose availability is uncertain. Buildings are often the main cause of peak demand, and they are believed to hold a large unrealised energy-efficiency potential. If realised, this potential could considerably mitigate the transition costs to low carbon societies, reducing average and peak electricity demands. We explore this potential in several cost-optimal global warming (GW) mitigation scenarios using a multi-sector TIMES energy system model of the province of Quebec for the period 2011–2050. Heating and conservation measures in the residential sector are modelled using building simulations and parameters' values from the literature. The intra-annual availability of renewable energy and electricity imports is derived from time-series analysis. Additionally, the influence of key parameters such as the projections of primary energy demand and emissions from reservoir impoundment is evaluated. Finally, we discuss some of the barriers that could hamper the energy transition and how they can be overcome. Results indicate that peak demand would rise by 30% due to GW mitigation efforts, but it can be effectively reduced by interventions in the residential sector. Heat pumps are the most cost effective heating technology, despite their lower efficiencies in cold climates. Better-insulated building envelopes have an important role in new houses, reducing by 14% the GW mitigation costs and suggesting that building codes should be more ambitious. The scenario considering denser urban developments has much lower GW mitigation costs, underscoring the importance of urban planning and potential changes in demand. The observed uptakes are contingent to the pricing of energy services being based on marginal costs and cost-optimising behaviour, and are less likely to take place with current market barriers. Finally, the emissions from reservoir creation alter the merit-order of electricity supply, favouring run-of-river power plants and suggesting that these emissions should be considered in GW mitigation scenarios.},

The use of a cutoff criterion reduces exponentially the number of connection points between models, facilitating the analysis of scenarios with a large number of technologies involved. The method is used to assess the potential effects of deploying low-carbon technologies to reduce combustion emissions in the province of Quebec (Canada). In the case of Quebec, the reduction of combustion emissions is largely achieved through electrification of energy services. Global warming mitigation efforts reduce the impact on human health and ecosystem quality, mainly because of lower global warming, water scarcity, and metal contamination impacts.

In TFE/water, the helix begins after the positively charged N-terminal residues and is most stable in the hydrophobic core, which correlates with results obtained previously for other signal sequences. The helix is weaker between the hydrophobic core and the C-terminus; such a break in the helix appears to be common to other signal peptides studied previously and could be of functional importance. No clear correlation could be established between the helicity of the peptides in TFE/water and their in vivo activities. All the peptides have a higher alpha-helix content in SDS than in TFE/water, and there is a good correlation between helix content in SDS and in vivo activity. Helicity in SDS for the functional peptides increases both at the N-terminus and in the hydrophobic core, and is driven by a strong association of the core with the hydrophobic chains of the detergent. The extension of the helix toward the N-terminus may be a result of neutralization of the N-terminal positive charges by the headgroups of the micelles, which removes unfavorable electrostatic interactions with the helix dipole. All these comparisons were facilitated by the use of upfield shifts of H alpha protons in helical regions relative to random coil chemical shifts, which also yielded estimates of helical content that correlated well with the CD results.},

North American natural gas consumption has been growing due to its decreasing cost in North America, policy initiatives, and its relatively low CO2 emissions rate compared to coal. In this paper, we study the implications for the natural gas sector of more stringent RPS under different coordination schemes in an integrated North American natural gas market. The scenarios assume that Renewable Energy Certificates generated in each region are traded 1) among all countries, 2) only within each country, and 3) only within model regions. We implement the three policies in four different energy and electricity models to generate projections of future natural gas consumption. Subsequently, we feed regional or country-level consumption changes of each model in each scenario to the North American Natural Gas Model. We find that lower RPS coordination among regions results in increased U.S. natural gas exports to Canada, increased U.S. natural gas prices, and decreased net U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico in the long term. Moreover, international coordination of RPS in the electricity sector leads to smaller price discrepancies in the U.S. natural gas market when compared to the reference scenario.},

We employ the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES), a bottom-up energy system model, along with a U.S. data set developed for this analysis. To characterize EDV deployment through 2050, varying assumptions related to crude oil and natural gas prices, a CO2 policy, a federal renewable portfolio standard, and vehicle battery cost were combined to form 108 different scenarios. Across these scenarios, oil prices and battery cost have the biggest effect on EDV deployment. The model results do not demonstrate a clear and consistent trend toward lower system-wide emissions as EDV deployment increases. In addition to the trade-off between lower tailpipe and higher electric sector emissions associated with plug-in vehicles, the scenarios produce system-wide emissions effects that often mask the effect of EDV deployment. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

For instance, a pipeline may be subject to technical problems that reduce its capacity. Or, oil supply by tanker may be reduced for political reasons or because of equipment mishaps at the point of origin or again, by a conscious decision by the supplier in order to obtain economic benefits. The purpose of this article is to formulate a simplified version of the above issue that mainly addresses long-term uncertainties. The formulation is done via a version of the TIAM-WORLD Integrated Model, modified to implement the approach of robust optimization. In our case, the approach can be interpreted as a revival of chance-constrained programming under the name of distributionally robust, or ambiguous, chance-constrained programming. We apply the approach to improve the security of supply to the European Energy system. The resulting formulation provides several interesting features regarding the security of EU energy supply and has also the advantage to be numerically tractable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We use a newly developed bottom-up model of the entire Canadian energy system (TIMES-Canada) to assess potentials for electrification of the road transport sector. A special emphasis has been put on the modelling of the Canadian road transport, by considering a variety of vehicles for passenger and freight transportation. Besides a business-as-usual (baseline) scenario, we have analysed an energy policy scenario imposing targets for electric vehicle penetration and a climate policy scenario imposing targets for greenhouse gas emission reduction. Our analysis shows on the one hand that electric vehicles penetrate notably the passenger vehicle market after 2040 in the baseline scenario and after 2030 in the energy policy scenario (following the assumed penetration targets). On the other hand, the assumed climate policy forces a stronger penetration of electric vehicles for passenger transportation, with a progressive phasing out of internal combustion engine vehicles, whereas the latter vehicles remain dominant for freight transportation but with a shift away of fossil fuels and in favour of biofuels. A sensitivity analysis on the (assumed) evolution of electric vehicles over time confirms these general trends. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our analysis is based on NATEM, an energy model that follows the TIMES approach of the International Energy Agency to represent in detail the energy sector of each of the 13 Canadian provinces and territories. NATEM shows that imposing different renewable penetration constraints for electricity generation has limited impacts outside the electricity sector. In particular, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to increase over time. Conversely, the imposition of a carbon tax has broader impacts on Canadian energy systems and on GHG emissions that are almost stabilized. However, the level of the carbon tax envisions by the EMF 34 study (increasing to a maximum level of $130 per tonne by 2050) is not high enough, in a Canadian context, to trigger a decrease of GHG emissions over time as mandated by Canadian climate policies.},

Risk reduction goals are combined with securing a minimum level of revenues from the hydrocarbon exports goals.

abstract = {The concern of the environmental impacts of electricity generation from fossil fuels and the desire for the country to be less dependent on fossil fuels have resulted in the U.S. Government offering various incentives to promote electricity from renewable sources. The U.S. electricity generation sector faces uncertainties that include future demand, the costs of supply, and the effects of regulation policies. National policies that aim to promote " clean" energy sources may have different impacts for different areas of the country, so it is important to understand the regional effects in addition to the larger national picture. The primary purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the uncertainties associated with the outcomes of possible regulations.The study does not intend to make predictions of the probability or direction of environmental policy in the U.S. Rather, we examine a number of different scenarios and explore their possible impacts on the future of energy system. We focus on future projections for electricity generation mix, electricity costs, emissions and emissions abatement costs under different scenarios. We have examined the key regulations through analyzing various assumptions using the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model and the Environmental Protection Agency's Nine Region MARKAL Database (EPAUS9r).We have analyzed how command-and-control regulations and market-based environmental policy approaches could change the mix of fuels used for electricity generation, the amount of CO2 emissions, and the cost of electricity in different parts of the U.S. In particular, we explore how some proposed features of different policies designs affect those outcomes and identify underlying causes of uncertainty about such outcomes.The analyzed policies lead to 6-25% reduction in total CO2 emissions by 2035. The policies also result in modest increases on electricity costs nationally, but this masks a wide variety of effects across regions. The relationship between the policy's effects on costs depends on the design of the policy, regional resource endowments, and the existing generation mix of the region. Generally, the regions with existing high electricity marginal costs would tend to see only minor costs increases and the regions with low electricity marginal costs would see substantial costs increases. Modeling results illustrate that different regions have different preferences in environmental regulations policies and design.},

abstract = {Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are omnipresent in energy policy analysis. Even though IAMs can successfully handle uncertainty pertinent to energy planning problems, they render multiple variables as outputs of the modelling. Therefore, policy makers are faced with multiple energy development scenarios and goals. Specifically, technical, environmental, and economic aspects are represented by multiple criteria, which, in turn, are related to conflicting objectives. Preferences of decision makers need to be taken into account in order to facilitate effective energy planning. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools are relevant in aggregating diverse information and thus comparing alternative energy planning options. The paper aims at ranking European Union (EU) energy development scenarios based on several IAMs with respect to multiple criteria. By doing so, we account for uncertainty surrounding policy priorities outside the IAM. In order to follow a sustainable approach, the ranking of policy options is based on EU energy policy priorities: energy efficiency improvements, increased use of renewables, reduction in and low mitigations costs of GHG emission. The ranking of scenarios is based on the estimates rendered by the two advanced IAMs relying on different approaches, namely TIAM and WITCH. The data are fed into the three MCDM techniques: the method of weighted aggregated sum/product assessment (WASPAS), the Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method, and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). As MCDM techniques allow assigning different importance to objectives, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to check the impact of perturbations in weights upon the final ranking. The rankings provided for the scenarios by different MCDM techniques diverge, first of all, due to the underlying assumptions of IAMs. Results of the analysis provide valuable insights in integrated application of both IAMs and MCDM models for developing energy policy scenarios and decision making in energy sector.},

Some of the key strengths of the model include simultaneous optimisation of operation and investments across the complete energy system over the whole modelling horizon, explicit representation of the most important sectors of the economy, modular structure and the possibility of linking to a computable general equilibrium model for an additional insight on, e.g. public finance or CO2-leakage. TIMES-DK is being developed in close collaboration between an energy agency, a university and a consulting firm, to improve its robustness, relevance and impact on policy making. It allows for a wide range of applications including exploratory energy scenarios and policy analysis. To meet challenges of the future, further development of the model is needed and consequently the article provides references to ongoing projects addressing current development needs, such as improved representation of transport and flexible handling of the temporal dimension.

Energy systems optimisation modelling (ESOM) is a widely used tool to inform pathways to address long-term energy challenges. This article describes a new ESOM developed to inform Ireland's energy system decarbonisation challenge. The TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM) is an optimisation model of the Irish energy system, which calculates the cost-optimal fuel and technology mix to meet future energy service demands in the transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture sectors, while respecting constraints in greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy resources, and feasible deployment rates. TIM is developed to take into account Ireland's unique energy system context, including a very high potential for offshore wind energy and the challenge of integrating this on a relatively isolated grid, a very ambitious decarbonisation target in the period to 2030, the policy need to inform 5-year carbon budgets to meet policy targets, and the challenge of decarbonising heat in the context of low building stock thermal efficiency and high reliance on fossil fuels. To that end, model features of note include future-proofing with flexible temporal and spatial definitions, with a possible hourly time resolution, unit commitment and capacity expansion features in the power sector, residential and passenger transport underpinned by detailed bottom-up sectoral models, cross-model harmonisation, and soft-linking with demand and macro models. The paper also outlines a priority list of future model developments to better meet the challenge of deeply decarbonising energy supply and demand, taking into account the equity, cost-effectiveness, and technical feasibility.

This translates to annual energy demands of 40 GJ per person, compared with the current Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 116 GJ and the global average of 55 GJ.

abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas is a major challenge. The oil and gas industry must contribute to this goal, primarily by controlling natural gas flaring and venting, which is a multibillion revenue loss. More than 4000 billion cubic feet of gas is flared every year in the world, leading to almost 400 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. In Latin America, 7.4% of the total gas produced in the region is flared or vented. This article evaluates the status of the flaring and venting of gas in Latin America, focusing on the southern cone countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile). It also develops a long-term perspective analysis for the region, using an integrated optimization model. Findings indicate that, when transport infrastructure is limited or there is no domestic demand to absorb the associated gas, flaring becomes the least-cost solution in the optimization model. This can be critical in the next decade, due to the excess gas supply or the lack of gas demand to absorb it. Particularly, the natural gas demand associated with the electricity generation in Brazil is reduced by the hydroelectric expansion and a sluggish economy. Therefore, policies must promote options to monetize the stranded gas.},

abstract = {The International Energy Agency Energy Technologies Perspectives (ETP) model is used to assess the prospects for carbon abatement options, including carbon capture and storage, up to 2050. Three main scenarios are considered: a Baseline scenario with current energy policies, an accelerated technology scenario that seeks to return energy-related CO2 emissions in 2050 to their level in 2005, and a scenario for which CO2 emissions are reduced at 50% of current levels by 2050. To reach these emissions reduction targets, annual global CO2 emissions in the year 2050 must be reduced by 35 GtCO2 to 48 GtCO2 compared to the Baseline scenario. The analysis presented here shows that a broad portfolio of emissions reducing technologies will need to be deployed across all economic sectors of the global economy to reach these targets. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is one of the suite of technologies employed across the globe to reach these targets. CCS adoption occurs in many aspects of the global economy and accounts for 14-19% of all emissions reductions. The total amount of CO2 captured and stored in deep geologic reservoirs up to 2050 ranges between 5.1 GtCO2 and 10.4 GtCO2 in these two climate policy scenarios. Up to 2030, more than half of total CCS deployment takes place in OECD countries. After 2035, emerging economies account for more than half of total CCS use. This paper also demonstrates that as the climate policy becomes more stringent it will be necessary for CCS to deploy more extensively in many different industries outside of the electric power sector which often receives the most attention in discussions of CCS's role in addressing climate change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper provides a method to identify drivers, barriers and synergies (DBS) related to the deployment of a CO2 pipeline network. The method was demonstrated for the West Mediterranean region (WMR) (i.e. Spain, Portugal and Morocco). The method comprises a literature review, analysis of embedded pipeline trajectories, interviews with experts, and workshops with stakeholders. Subsequently, the collected information was used to identify route specific DBS in several CO2 pipeline network deployment scenarios that were modeled for the WMR. Most identified DBS apply to CO2 pipeline transport in general. The barriers (e.g. technical knowledge gaps, outstanding legislative issues, lack of financial incentive) can in principle be tackled to make the design, construction and operation of a CO2 pipeline network possible, but could sometimes lead to somewhat higher costs. Furthermore, there are also facilitating processes (e.g. experience with CO2 pipeline transport for EOR). Cost benefits due to pipeline oversizing were identified as a route specific driver, whereas crossings of mountains, water and nature areas are route specific barriers. Installing CO2 pipelines along natural gas pipelines could be either a route specific synergy or barrier, depending on site conditions. Finally, several key measures were proposed to enable CO2 pipeline networks in the future.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview and a critical analysis of the recent literature on incorporating induced technical change in energy systems models. Special emphasis is put on surveying recent studies aimed at integrating learning-by-doing into bottom-up energy systems models through so-called learning curves, and on analyzing the relevance of learning curve analysis for understanding the process of innovation and technology diffusion in the energy sector. The survey indicates that this model work represents a major advance in energy research, and embeds important policy implications, not the least concerning the cost and the timing of environmental policies (including carbon emission constraints). However, bottom-up energy models with endogenous learning are also limited in their characterization of technology diffusion and innovation. While they provide a detailed account of technical options - which is absent in many top-down models - they also lack important aspects of diffusion behavior that are captured in top-down representations. For instance, they often fail in capturing strategic technology diffusion behavior in the energy sector as well as the energy sector's endogenous responses to policy, and they neglect important general equilibrium impacts (such as the opportunity cost of redirecting R&D support to the energy sector). Some suggestions on how innovation and diffusion modeling in bottom-up analysis can be improved are put forward. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, municipalities have initiated the development of Sustainable Energy Action Plans as a key document to introduce the respective course of actions in order to define the technology adaptation process, identify the principal sources of CO2 emissions and their respective reduction potentials for the designated target years. A complete energy-strategy plan is required to handle the financial, technical, and environmental dimensions, not just for the country, but also for cities. As a powerful energy model generator among the energy planning and optimization tools, TIMES utilizes the energy, economy, and environmental parameters simultaneously. This paper aims to oversee and indicate the possible implications of “2023 energy targets” of Turkey in a city-level energy modeling. In this perspective, the city of Burdur is selected as the target to implement the designated solar energy policy targets. With this paper, nationwide official targets are evaluated for a city level by calculating long-term effects and costs to the system. A total of 5000 MW of solar energy utilization target of Turkey has been reduced to the urban level for Burdur, depending on its share of solar energy, and then applied as an alternative scenario on the energy model developed for this analysis. The results show that the solar share of the total installed capacity of Burdur city will reach 49% while tripling the solar-based electricity generation in its energy mix.},

abstract = {The influence of economic and demographic variables on the annual electricity consumption in Italy has been investigated with the intention to develop a long-term consumption forecasting model. The time period considered for the historical data is from 1970 to 2007. Different regression models were developed, using historical electricity consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita) and population. A first part of the paper considers the estimation of GDP, price and GDP per capita elasticities of domestic and non-domestic electricity consumption. The domestic and non-domestic short run price elasticities are found to be both approximately equal to -0.06, while long run elasticities are equal to -0.24 and -0.09, respectively. On the contrary, the elasticities of GDP and GDP per capita present higher values. In the second part of the paper, different regression models, based on co-integrated or stationary data, are presented. Different statistical tests are employed to check the validity of the proposed models. A comparison with national forecasts, based on complex econometric models, such as Markal-Time, was performed, showing that the developed regressions are congruent with the official projections, with deviations of ±1% for the best case and ±11% for the worst. These deviations are to be considered acceptable in relation to the time span taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Policies to encourage renewable electricity generation have grown at national and subnational levels. These measures are often characterized by geographical fragmentation, as jurisdictions typically select their own renewable targets without coordinating with neighboring regions. However, the literature on renewable policies has not examined the effects of cross-border interactions and coordination, especially in a multi-model comparison to examine robustness to structural and parametric uncertainties. This paper assesses the impacts of regional and international renewable policy coordination on economic, environmental, and planning outcomes in the North American power sector. Using a multi-model comparison with eight energy-economic models, the analysis demonstrates how prospective renewable mandate trade formulations impact power sector outcomes like capacity planning decisions, costs, emissions, trade, and infrastructure investments. Model results suggest that renewable policy coordination can lower costs by up to 20% for the stringencies examined here. Fragmentation lowers gas-fired generation, but coal and nuclear are also displaced, especially when regions comply without trade. Policy costs decrease for the U.S. with higher regional and international coordination, but magnitudes vary by model. Restricting coordination leads to higher capacity investments, and absent incentives to enhance efficiency, grids do not share resources to balance variability. Transmission investments and trade are highest with international policy coordination.},

When choosing the location for increased production capacity, the producer has typically limited incentives to take fully into account the investments costs of the subsequent need for increased grid capacity. This may lead to inefficient choices of location. We explore analytically the design of feed-in premiums that secure an optimal coordinated development of the entire electricity system. We show that with binding electricity transmission constraints, feed-in premiums should differ across locations. By the use of a numerical energy system model (TIMES), we investigate the potential welfare cost of a non-coordinated development of grids and wind power production capacity in the Norwegian energy system. Our result indicates that grid investment costs can be substantially higher when the location decision is based on uniform feed-in premiums compared with geographically differentiated premiums However, the difference in the sum of grid investment cost and production cost is much more modest, as location based on uniform feed-in premiums leads to capacity increase in areas with better wind conditions.},

abstract = {Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) currently have the challenge of high CAPEX mainly associated to the fuel cell. This study investigates strategies to promote FCEV deployment and overcome this initial high cost by combining a detailed simulation model of the passenger transport sector with an energy system model. The focus is on an energy system with 95% CO2 reduction by 2050. Soft-linking by taking the powertrain shares by country from the simulation model is preferred because it considers aspects such as car performance, reliability and safety while keeping the cost optimization to evaluate the impact on the rest of the system. This caused a 14% increase in total cost of car ownership compared to the cost before soft-linking. Gas reforming combined with CO2 storage can provide a low-cost hydrogen source for FCEV in the first years of deployment. Once a lower CAPEX for FCEV is achieved, a higher hydrogen cost from electrolysis can be afforded. The policy with the largest impact on FCEV was a purchase subsidy of 5 k€ per vehicle in the 2030–2034 period resulting in 24.3 million FCEV (on top of 67 million without policy) sold up to 2050 with total subsidies of 84 bln€. 5 bln€ of R&D incentives in the 2020–2024 period increased the cumulative sales up to 2050 by 10.5 million FCEV. Combining these two policies with infrastructure and fuel subsidies for 2030–2034 can result in 76 million FCEV on the road by 2050 representing more than 25% of the total car stock. Country specific incentives, split of demand by distance or shift across modes of transport were not included in this study.},

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) includes the combination of hydrogen with CO2 to produce liquid fuels and satisfy mostly transport demand. This study assesses the role of these pathways across scenarios that achieve 80–95% CO2 reduction by 2050 (vs. 1990) using the JRC-EU-TIMES model. The gaps in the literature covered in this study include a broader spatial coverage (EU28+) and hydrogen use in all sectors (beyond transport). The large uncertainty in the possible evolution of the energy system has been tackled with an extensive sensitivity analysis. 15 parameters were varied to produce more than 50 scenarios. Results indicate that parameters with the largest influence are the CO2 target, the availability of CO2 underground storage and the biomass potential. Hydrogen demand increases from 7 mtpa today to 20–120 mtpa (2.4–14.4 EJ/yr), mainly used for PtL (up to 70 mtpa), transport (up to 40 mtpa) and industry (25 mtpa). Only when CO2 storage was not possible due to a political ban or social acceptance issues, was electrolysis the main hydrogen production route (90% share) and CO2 use for PtL became attractive. Otherwise, hydrogen was produced through gas reforming with CO2 capture and the preferred CO2 sink was underground. Hydrogen and PtL contribute to energy security and independence allowing to reduce energy related import cost from 420 bln€/yr today to 350 or 50 bln€/yr for 95% CO2 reduction with and without CO2 storage. Development of electrolyzers, fuel cells and fuel synthesis should continue to ensure these technologies are ready when needed. Results from this study should be complemented with studies with higher spatial and temporal resolution. Scenarios with global trading of hydrogen and potential import to the EU were not included.},

This study focuses specifically on the methanation component of PtM in 2050. Scenarios with 80–95% CO2 reduction by 2050 (vs. 1990) are analyzed and barriers and drivers for methanation are identified. PtM arises for scenarios with 95% CO2 reduction, no CO2 underground storage and low CAPEX (75 €/kW only for methanation). Capacity deployed across EU is 40 GW (8% of gas demand) for these conditions, which increases to 122 GW when liquefied methane gas (LMG) is used for marine transport. The simultaneous occurrence of all positive drivers for PtM, which include limited biomass potential, low Power-to-Liquid performance, use of PtM waste heat, among others, can increase this capacity to 546 GW (75% of gas demand). Gas demand is reduced to between 3.8 and 14 EJ (compared to ∼20 EJ for 2015) with lower values corresponding to scenarios that are more restricted. Annual costs for PtM are between 2.5 and 10 bln€/year with EU28's GDP being 15.3 trillion €/year (2017). Results indicate that direct subsidy of the technology is more effective and specific than taxing the fossil alternative (natural gas) if the objective is to promote the technology.

This study analyses the role of different technologies in the EU-27 with regard to efficiency improvements, fuel switching and energy saving measures under such a climate policy target. The analysis is carried out using the regionalised Pan-European TIMES energy system model, a technology oriented, linear optimisation model. Thereby limited resources and import potentials of various energy carriers, competition among different sectors and the country-specific differences in energy demand are taken into account. As a result, it turns out that the structure of energy use inside the EU-27 is much stronger, influenced by political targets and positions regarding climate protection, energy security and the use of nuclear energy than by available technologies. In the case of climate protection polices and limited use of nuclear energy, the most important measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases are an increased use of renewables, carbon capture and storage, fuel switching and the intensified application of electricity in the end use sectors. Efficiency improvements play an additional role when security of supply is taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The need to have a suitable transport infrastructure, its implications over time and its related costs have only more recently attracting the attention and getting priority in the R&D agenda of the European Countries. This is partly because research on CO2 transport and storage needs to be realized at the localregional level, unlike the technological research on CO2 capture which is not country dependent.

abstract = {The integration of hydrogen energy systems in the overall energy system is an important and complex subject for hydrogen supply chain management. The efficiency of the integration depends on finding optimum pathways for hydrogen supply. Accordingly, energy systems modelling methods and tools have been implemented to obtain the best configuration of hydrogen processes for a defined system. The appropriate representation of hydrogen technologies becomes an important stage for energy system modelling activities. This study, split in consecutive parts, has been conducted to analyse how representative hydrogen supply pathways can be integrated in energy systems modelling. The current paper, the first part of a larger study, presents stylised pathways of hydrogen supply chain options, derived on the basis of a detailed literature review. It aims at establishing a reference hydrogen energy system architecture for energy modelling tools. The subsequent papers of the study will discuss the techno-economic assumptions of the hydrogen supply chain components for energy modelling purposes. {\textcopyright} 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {In this study, current and future anthropogenic hydrogen (H2) emissions to the atmosphere from technological processes are assessed. Current emissions are dominated by the direct exhaust gas of road-based motor vehicles and losses during the industrial production of H2 from fossil-fuels. H2 emissions from transportation are estimated at 4.5 Tg for 2010. An additional ∼0.5-2 Tg H2 are estimated to be lost to the atmosphere from industrial processes in 2010. In 2020, emissions from transportation are estimated at approximately 50% of those in 2010. Future emissions will occur as losses along the entire production, distribution, and end-use chain, including emissions from H2 fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). In 2050, overall anthropogenic H2 emissions will only approach current levels at high-end loss rates; direct emissions from transportation are expected to be significantly lower than current levels. In 2100, an average loss rate of 0.5% would result in overall H2 emissions exceeding current levels even with no net H2 emissions from FCVs. However, based on an average loss rate of 0.1%, H2 emission factors from FCVs on the order to 120-170 mg km-1 are projected to result in overall anthropogenic H2 emissions similar to 2010 levels. {\textcopyright} 2010 Professor T.

abstract = {Heterogeneous data, different definitions and incompatible models are a huge problem in many domains, with no exception for the field of energy systems analysis. Hence, it is hard to re-use results, compare model results or couple models at all. Ontologies provide a precisely defined vocabulary to build a common and shared conceptualisation of the energy domain. Here, we present the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) developed for the domain of energy systems analysis. Using the OEO provides several benefits for the community. First, it enables consistent annotation of large amounts of data from various research projects. One example is the Open Energy Platform (OEP). Adding such annotations makes data semantically searchable, exchangeable, re-usable and interoperable. Second, computational model coupling becomes much easier. The advantages of using an ontology such as the OEO are demonstrated with three use cases: data representation, data annotation and interface homogenisation. We also describe how the ontology can be used for linked open data (LOD).},

abstract = {Use of bioenergy can contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions and increased energy security. However, even though biomass is a renewable resource, the potential is limited, and efficient use of available biomass resources will become increasingly important. This paper aims to explore system interactions related to future bioenergy utilization and cost-efficient bioenergy technology choices under stringent CO2 constraints. In particular, the study investigates system effects linked to integration of advanced biofuel production with district heating and industry under different developments in the electricity sector and biomass supply system. The study is based on analysis with the MARKAL_Sweden model, which is a bottom-up, cost-optimization model covering the Swedish energy system. A time horizon to 2050 is applied. The results suggest that system integration of biofuel production has noteworthy effects on the overall system level, improves system cost-efficiency and influences parameters such as biomass price, marginal CO2 emission reduction costs and cost-efficient biofuel choices in the transport sector. In the long run and under stringent CO2 constraints, system integration of biofuel production has, however, low impact on total bioenergy use, which is largely decided by supply-related constraints, and on total transport biofuel use, which to large extent is driven by demand.},

Furthermore, biomass gasification could also be used for the efficient production of biofuels for transport. In this study, different applications of biomass gasification in connection to district heating (DH) are analysed and contrasted to conventional technology options. An application of the cost-optimizing energy system model MARKAL with a detailed description of the DH sector in a southwestern region of Sweden was developed within the study and used in the analysis. Policy measures for CO2 reduction and for promotion of "green" electricity are assumed, and required subsidy levels for large-scale production of transport biofuels are calculated. The model also operates with different supplies of biomass: a local supply at a lower cost and an international supply of refined biomass at a slightly higher cost. The study shows that investments in BIGCC CHP are often cost-efficient in cases with low ambitions regarding transport biofuels. However, due to limitations in heat demand and in local, lower cost, supply of biomass, investment in biofuel production means less investment in BIGCC CHP and, thereby, a smaller electricity production. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates requirements for policy support to overcome techno-economic barriers of biogas utilisation and effects of different biogas distribution strategies. Two potential sectors for biogas use are covered: the transport sector and the district heating sector. A quantitative, optimising, energy system modelling approach is applied and the region of V{\"{a}}stra G{\"{o}}taland, Sweden, is studied. The model has a high geographical resolution and locations of both biogas feedstock and potential markets are taken into account. The results show that a small part of the technical biogas potential can be cost-effectively utilised without biogas subsidies or larger infrastructural investments. Comparably low subsidies give significant increases in cost-effective biogas utilisation levels, but utilisation close to the full technical potential is linked to high subsidies. From a techno-economic perspective, biogas is best used as vehicle gas. Since local vehicle gas markets are limited, enhanced biogas distribution conditions not only imply larger total cost-effective biogas utilisation, but also a larger share of biogas as vehicle gas. Compared to distribution strategies based on truck transports and regional biogas grids, an expanded natural gas grid presents possibilities but also risks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

To formulate policies and to cost-effectively meet oil reduction objectives, assessments and comparisons of the long-term economic performances of different technology trajectories are essential. In this work, the energy and technology costs associated with reducing oil consumption in passenger cars in Sweden are calculated for a number of possible future transport fuel pathways and for different energy prices and climate policies. An optimisation model is applied in a simulatory multiple-run approach for this purpose. The model encompasses the transportation sector, as well as the stationary energy system. In terms of results, a methanol-based pathway gives incremental system costs in the range of - 0.9-3. billion EUR for a complete phase-out of passenger car oil up to 2030. As compared to the methanol pathway, other biomass gasification-based fuel pathways involve additional incremental system costs in the region of 3. billion EUR, whereas ethanol- and electricity-based pathways give additional incremental system costs of 4-5. billion EUR. At lower oil reduction levels, the cost differences between the pathways are smaller and the electricity-based pathway is significantly more cost-competitive. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {First and second generation biofuels are among few low-carbon alternatives for road transport that currently are commercially available or in an early commercialization phase. They are thus potential options for meeting climate targets in the medium term. For the case of Sweden, we investigate cost-efficient use of biofuels in road transport under system-wide CO2 reduction targets to 2050, and the effects of implementation of targets for an almost fossil-free road transport sector to 2030. We apply the bottom-up, optimization MARKAL_Sweden model, which covers the entire Swedish energy system including the transport sector. For CO2 reductions of 80% to 2050 in the Swedish energy system as a whole, the results of the main scenario show an annual growth rate for road transport biofuels of about 6% from 2010 to 2050, with biofuels accounting for 78% of road transport final energy use in 2050. The preferred biofuel choices are methanol and biomethane. When introducing additional fossil fuel phase-out policies in road transport (-80% to 2030), a doubling of the growth rate to 2030 is required and system CO2 abatement costs increases by 6% for the main scenario. Results imply that second generation biofuels, along with energy-efficient vehicle technologies such as plug-in hybrids, can be an important part of optimized system solutions meeting stringent medium-term climate targets.},

abstract = {Bioenergy could contribute both to the reduction of greenhouse gases and to increased energy security, but the extent of this contribution strongly depends on the cost and potential of biomass resources. For Sweden, this study investigates how the implementation of policies for CO2 reduction and for phase out of fossil fuels in road transport affect the future utilization of biomass, in the stationary energy system and in the transport sector, and its price. The analysis is based on the bottom-up, optimization MARKAL_Sweden model, which includes a comprehensive representation of the national energy system. For the analysis, the biomass supply representation of MARKAL_Sweden is updated and improved by the use of, e.g., forestry forecasting modeling and through construction of detailed biomass supply curves. A time horizon up to 2050 is applied. The results indicate a potential for significantly higher use of bioenergy. In the main analysis scenario, in which CO2 reduction of 80% by 2050 is imposed on the Swedish energy system, the total bioenergy utilization increases by 63% by 2050 compared to 2010. The largest increase occurs in the transport sector, which by 2050 accounts for 43% of the total primary bioenergy use. The high demand and strong competition significantly increase biomass prices and lead to the utilization of higher cost biomass sources such as stumps and cultivated energy forest, as well as use of pulpwood resources for energy purposes.},

In unconstrained emission scenarios, within the range of future technology performances considered in the present analysis, the cost of nuclear energy is shown to dominate all others in affecting future emissions.

abstract = {The clean development mechanism (CDM), one of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, has not received noticeable attention in the applied modeling literature. In this paper we develop a policy-oriented trading model explicitly including the key features likely to influence the supply and demand of CDM projects. This model allows us to evaluate the contribution of the CDM to climate policies at the national level. With an application to Belgium we show that the CDM could reduce the cost of the Kyoto Protocol by a factor 10. Policy analyses reveal that some features (e.g. the market share) have much more influence on this result than others (notably the transaction costs). Moreover, equilibrium effects can sometimes exceed direct effects so that, all in all, a larger domestic abatement could be justified by the desire to reduce what we call carbon dependence. Policy implications and perspectives for the CDM are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society for Policy Modeling.},

The project was a ‘first of its kind' piece of integrated modelling aimed at a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between the physical economy and natural resource use in Australia. The modelling allowed ground breaking results (Schandl et al. (2015) Australia is ‘free to choose' economic growth and falling environmental pressures, Nature DOI 10.1038/nature16065). Soon after, CSIRO and National Australia Bank (NAB) partnered to create the second phase of the Australian National Outlook, using CSIRO's next generation integrated modelling suite to investigate the issues most pertinent to the future success of Australia's economy. Australia's business community was engaged to highlight the issues most pertinent for the future of Australia's economy. The scope of ANO 2019 was significantly broader than ANO 2015, in that there was a greater focus on economic modelling as well as a consideration of cities, infrastructure, productivity and services. CSIRO and NAB harnessed the expertise of over 50 senior leaders (the Outlook Members) across 24 of Australia's top corporations, organisations and universities to pair with CSIRO's modelling and qualitative analysis. A full exploration of results and narrative interpretation can be read in the Australian National Outlook 2019 report (CSIRO and NAB (2019) Australian National Outlook. CSIRO, Australia).

abstract = {Future power systems will require large shares of low-carbon generators such as renewables and power plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to keep global warming below 2. °C. Intermittent renewables increase the system-wide demand for flexibility and affect the operation of thermal power plants. We investigate the operation of future power plants by first composing a comprehensive overview of the operational flexibility of current and future power plants. Next, a combined long-term optimization and hourly simulation is performed with the soft-linked MARKAL-NL-UU and REPOWERS models for The Netherlands in 2030 and 2050. We quantify and compare the technical and economic performance of power plants for four distinctly different future scenarios. We find that future low-carbon power systems will have large shares of intermittent renewable sources (19-42%) and also a 2-38% higher variability in residual load compared to the Baseline scenario. Hence, power plant operation will be more variable, which reduces their efficiency by 0.6-1.6% compared to the full-load efficiency. Enough flexibility is present in future power systems to accommodate renewables, due to advances in power plant flexibility and interconnectors. As a result, generators with CCS have a large market share (23-64% of power generated). Moreover, the current energy-based market model generates insufficient revenues: the price received per MWh covers only 84% (±30%) of the total generation costs per MWh of 77. €/MWh (±12€). This will discourage new investments in generation capacity and reduce power system adequacy. New or additional market designs may be required to ensure system adequacy in future power systems.},

abstract = {Vehicle automation has the potential to drastically transform transportation, with important implications for energy and the environment. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of automation on travel demand and vehicle efficiency. We utilize the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) energy system model to examine four previously published scenarios that consider different effects of automation on efficiency and demand. We do not replicate detailed estimation of individual mechanisms but apply key outcomes from prior studies within a broader energy system framework. Our analysis adds insights on fuel switching, upstream impacts, and air emissions. MARKAL dynamically captures interactions between transportation and non-transportation sectors, which is important given that the revolutionary shifts from automation may invalidate static assumptions. Model results suggest that increasing travel demands from automation may boost fuel use and petroleum-based fuel prices, potentially increasing the market penetration of alternative-fuel vehicles. In contrast, dramatic efficiency improvements from automation could drive fuel prices lower, greatly reducing the competitiveness of alternative-fueled vehicles. Furthermore, these shifts could yield positive or negative environmental impacts. Some automation scenarios even resulted in counterintuitive results. For example, if high levels of efficiency improvement drive out alternative-fuel vehicles, such as battery electric and hybrids, a net worsening of air quality relative to the other scenarios could result. We also found system-level dynamics to be key. For example, reductions in liquid fuel prices led to increased consumption, and the resulting increase in air pollutant emissions offset a portion of the potential air quality benefits of automation.},

abstract = {This study aims to determine how incorporating damages into energy costs would impact the US energy system. Damages from health impacting pollutants (NOx, SO2, particulate matter — PM, and volatile organic compounds — VOCs) as well as greenhouse gases (GHGs) are accounted for by applying emissions fees equal to estimated external damages associated with life-cycle emissions. We determine that in a least-cost framework, fees reduce emissions, including those not targeted by the fees. Emissions reductions are achieved through the use of control technologies, energy efficiency, and shifting of fuels and technologies used in energy conversion. The emissions targeted by fees decrease, and larger fees lead to larger reductions. Compared to the base case with no fees, in 2045, SO2emissions are reduced up to 70%, NOxemissions up to 30%, PM2.5up to 45%, and CO2by as much as 36%. Emissions of some pollutants, particularly VOCs and methane, sometimes increase when fees are applied. The co-benefit of reduction in non-targeted pollutants is not always larger for larger fees. The degree of co-reduced emissions depends on treatment of life-cycle emissions and the technology pathway used to achieve emissions reductions, including the mix of efficiency, fuel switching, and emissions control technologies.},

abstract = {Offshore wind is an established technology in Europe and Asia, but it has not yet gained market share in the United States. There is, however, increasing interest in offshore wind development in many coastal regions of the United States. As offshore wind grows in those regions it will displace existing and future electric generation assets, which will lead to changes in the emissions from the electric power sector. This research explores combinations of two electric sector drivers, offshore wind capital costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) caps, to measure the changes in the energy mix and quantify offshore wind's impact on electric sector emissions. An energy system modeling approach is applied, using a nested parametric sensitivity analysis, to generate and explore potential energy futures and analyze the air quality and greenhouse gas emissions benefits of offshore wind as an energy source. The analysis shows that offshore wind capacity was added due to cost reductions more than CO2 cap stringency, though both increased capacity additions. Capacity varied more by CO2 cap stringency at higher prices and less at lower prices. CO2 mitigation led to reductions in all five emissions investigated, regardless of offshore wind cost. Offshore wind-specific reductions were only consistent across all CO2 caps for CO2 and methane (CH4), though offshore wind-specific reductions were found for all emissions in the absence of CO2 caps. Results are presented nationally, analyzing the differences in adoption of offshore wind and how this technology provides a broader range of emission reduction options for the power sector.},

For this paper, 16 modeling teams reported resulting emissions projections, energy system evolution, and economic activity. This paper provides an overview of the study, documents the scenario design, provides a roadmap for complementary forthcoming papers from this study, and offers an initial summary and comparison of results for net-zero CO2 by 2050 scenarios in the United States. We compare various outcomes across models and scenarios, such as emissions, energy use, fuel mix evolution, and technology adoption. Despite disparate model structure and sources for input assumptions, there is broad agreement in energy system trends across models towards deep decarbonization of the electricity sector coupled with increased end-use electrification of buildings, transportation, and to a lesser extent industry. All models deploy negative emissions technologies (e.g., direct air capture and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) in addition to land sinks to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions. Important differences emerged in the results, showing divergent pathways among end-use sectors with deep electrification and grid decarbonization as necessary but not sufficient conditions to achieve net zero. These differences will be explored in the papers complementing this study to inform efforts to reach net-zero emissions and future research needs.},

abstract = {Circular economy is a new economic model that aims at overcoming today's linear “take, make, dispose” pattern, decoupling global economic development from finite resource consumption. Household appliances are a promising field for the adoption of Circular Economy, being one of the most resource-intensive industries and due to the global e-waste problem. The aim of this work is to quantify the potential contribution of making the household appliances sector more circular to the decarbonization of the Italian energy system, using the TIMES-RSE model. First, a literature review of the available circular measures was performed and used as a basis for modeling assumptions. The following circular measures were considered: extending the lifetime of appliances, increased adoption of remanufactured appliances, growing importance of leasing, lower average washing temperature for washing machines, and lower usage of tumble dryers. Second, each circular practice was modeled either as a new technology available for the optimization of the system or as a change in demand for a certain commodity. The reference scenario is the Italian Long Term Strategy. It is shown that the modeled circular practices can reduce the energy consumption of household appliances in 2050 by 0,327 Mtoe (−16%) and cut in half their costs through the 2020–2050 period, saving 96 billion euros (−47%). Moreover, savings could be even higher if efforts are taken to remove barriers to their diffusion, including consumers' habits and manufacturers' inertia. As the energy weight of appliances is low within the overall residential sector, energy savings of these circular practices are negligible at the sectoral level, however, economic savings of 107 billion euros are achieved over 2020–2050 (−22%).},

In England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for approximately half of all water abstractions and 40% of non-tidal surface water abstractions. We present a model that quantifies current water use of the UK electricity sector and use it to test six decarbonisation pathways to 2050. The pathways consist of a variety of generation technologies, with associated cooling methods, water use factors and cooling water sources. We find that up to 2030, water use across the six pathways is fairly consistent and all achieve significant reductions in both carbon and water intensity, based upon a transition to closed loop and hybrid cooling systems. From 2030 to 2050 our results diverge. Pathways with high levels of carbon capture and storage result in freshwater consumption that exceeds current levels (37-107%), and a consumptive intensity that is 30-69% higher. Risks to the aquatic environment will be intensified if generation with carbon capture and storage is clustered. Pathways of high nuclear capacity result in tidal and coastal abstraction that exceed current levels by 148-399%. Whilst reducing freshwater abstractions, the marine environment will be impacted if a shortage of coastal sites leads to clustering of nuclear reactors and concentration of heated water discharges. The pathway with the highest level of renewables has both lowest abstraction and consumption of water. Freshwater consumption can also be minimised through use of hybrid cooling, which despite marginally higher costs and emissions, would reduce dependence on scarce water resources thus increase security of supply. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Optimization modeling, scenario development, user interaction, policy analysis and visual display are seamlessly integrated into the UREM-IDSS. Uncertainties in energy-related parameters are effectively addressed through the interval linear programming (ILP) approach, improving the robustness of the UREM-IDSS for real-world applications. Thus, it can be used as an efficient tool for analyzing and visualizing impacts of energy and environmental policies, regional/community sustainable development strategies, emission reduction measures and climate change in an interactive, flexible and dynamic context. The Region of Waterloo has been selected to demonstrate the applicability and capability of the UREM-IDSS. A variety of scenarios (including a reference case) have been identified based on different energy management policies and sustainable development strategies for in-depth analysis of interactions existing among energy, socio-economy, and environment in the Region. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated, reflecting complex tradeoffs among energy-related, environmental and economic considerations. Results indicate that the UREM-IDSS can be successfully used for evaluating and analyzing not only the effects of an individual policy scenario, but also the variations between different scenarios compared with a reference case. Also, the UREM-IDSS can help tackle dynamic and interactive characteristics of the energy management system in the Region of Waterloo, and can address issues concerning cost-effective allocation of energy resources and services. Thus, it can be used by decision makers as an effective technique in examining and visualizing impacts of energy and environmental policies, regional/community development strategies, emission reduction measures, and climate change within an integrated and dynamic framework. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this study, an inexact community-scale energy model (ICS-EM) has been developed for planning renewable energy management (REM) systems under uncertainty. This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), chance-constrained programming (CCP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. ICS-EM allows uncertainties presented as both probability distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework. It can also facilitate capacity-expansion planning for energy-production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context. Complexities in energy management systems can be systematically reflected, thus applicability of the modeling process can be highly enhanced. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violation have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation and capacity-expansion plans with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and constraint-violation risks can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase system stability, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of potential instability of the management system. They are helpful for supporting (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy consumption, economic development and energy structure, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply security. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Management of energy resources is crucial for many regions throughout the world. Many economic, environmental and political factors are having significant effects on energy management practices, leading to a variety of uncertainties in relevant decision making. The objective of this research is to identify optimal strategies in the planning of energy management systems under multiple uncertainties through the development of a fuzzy-random interval programming (FRIP) model. The method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), superiority-inferiority-based fuzzy-stochastic programming (SI-FSP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Such a FRIP model allows multiple uncertainties presented as interval values, possibilistic and probabilistic distributions, as well as their combinations within a general optimization framework. It can also be used for facilitating capacity-expansion planning of energy-production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context. Complexities in energy management systems can be systematically reflected, thus applicability of the modeling process can be highly enhanced. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term energy management planning for a region with three cities. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems were generated. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violation were obtained. They could be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation and capacity-expansion plans with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and constraint-violation risks could be successfully tackled, i.e., higher costs will increase system stability, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of potential instability of the management system. Moreover, multiple uncertainties existing in the planning of energy management systems can be effectively addressed, improving robustness of the existing optimization methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper we investigate CO2 emission scenarios for Colombia and the effects of implementing carbon taxes and abatement targets on the energy system. By comparing baseline and policy scenario results from two integrated assessment partial equilibrium models TIAM-ECN and GCAM and two general equilibrium models Phoenix and MEG4C, we provide an indication of future developments and dynamics in the Colombian energy system. Currently, the carbon intensity of the energy system in Colombia is low compared to other countries in Latin America. However, this trend may change given the projected rapid growth of the economy and the potential increase in the use of carbon-based technologies. Climate policy in Colombia is under development and has yet to consider economic instruments such as taxes and abatement targets. This paper shows how taxes or abatement targets can achieve significant CO2 reductions in Colombia. Though abatement may be achieved through different pathways, taxes and targets promote the entry of cleaner energy sources into the market and reduce final energy demand through energy efficiency improvements and other demand-side responses. The electric power sector plays an important role in achieving CO2 emission reductions in Colombia, through the increase of hydropower, the introduction of wind technologies, and the deployment of biomass, coal and natural gas with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Uncertainty over the prevailing mitigation pathway reinforces the importance of climate policy to guide sectors toward low-carbon technologies. This paper also assesses the economy-wide implications of mitigation policies such as potential losses in GDP and consumption. An assessment of the legal, institutional, social and environmental barriers to economy-wide mitigation policies is critical yet beyond the scope of this paper.},

@article{Calvillo2017,
abstract = {The Scottish Government has set very ambitious targets and policies in its Climate Change Plan to decarbonise the 
energy system. The Scottish TIMES model is as a key tool informing these new climate change policies. TIMES is a well-known, widely used model. However, the adequacy of TIMES for energy efficiency policy analysis has not been assessed 
in the literature. 
This report sets out the potential for using TIMES to understand the system impacts of energy efficiency improvements, based upon work by climateXChange Fellow Christian Calvillo at Strathclyde University. 
This report describes the generic structure of the TIMES modelling framework to help a wider audience to understand 
the capabilities of this type of
 model. 
The report reviews energy efficiency related work in TIMES, and assesses the main 
strengths and limitations of TIMES. The main challenges identified in the specific context of using TIMES for 
energy efficiency analysis are:
•Energy efficiency implementation in TIMES is not straightforward. Several approaches could be followed, 
delivering potentially different results.
•Decisions are cost driven.   The cost minimisation   algorithm would lead to outcomes   involving extreme specialisation (corner solutions), if not prevented by user determined constraints (e.g. imposing 
maximum shares for different technologies).
•Energy demands and actions and reactions across the wider economy impacts are not modelled
within TIMES. More generally, market “problems” and other drivers for consumer behaviour are not captured. The report outlines several options to address or mitigate these modelling issues, and proposes ways forward in using
TIMES for energy efficiency analysis. The three main possibilities are:
1.Use TIMES as it is. This should be considered as the first step in energy efficiency analysis. The current versions 
of TIMES can deliver reasonable outputs and useful insight. However, any limitations of TIMES should be taken 
into account when interpreting the results.
2.Develop TIMES improvements. Implementing improvements in the specification of the TIMES 
model to deal with issues such as those outlined above is potentially a second step in the analysis of energy efficiency changes, one that is likely only to be feasible in the medium term. Some of these developments might require relatively little 
time and resources to implement, while others will require important changes on the model structure and data. 
Hence, an assessment of the potential benefits in relation to the required resources for a TIMES improvement 
must be done beforehand, as it might be more convenient to rely on soft-linking with other models.
3.Soft-linking with other models. That is, modelling the type of behaviours and sectors not captured in TIMES in 
other models and using the outputs to inform and/or interact with TIMES. 
This solution can potentially give relevant and/or more accurate information that could be very difficult to get from TIMES alone. In particular, the 
soft-linking with a 
multiple sector economy
-wide ‘computable general 
equilibrium (CGE) model approach is very relevant for energy efficiency policy analysis (and such a modelling framework is currently available to Scottish 
Government), as many of the expected outcomes go beyond the energy system (e.g. reducing energy poverty, job creation, economy boosts, etc.). In addition, this setup better represents consumer behaviour, which translates to more realistic technology adoption scenarios.},

abstract = {Electrifying transport to meet local pollution and overall net zero carbon ambitions is now a key UK policy focus, but this will have important impacts on the energy system, the economy, and the environment. Understanding the changes that the electrification of transport will bring is crucial for developing sustainable policies for net zero goals and a just transition. A literature is emerging to analyse the impact of a large-scale penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), but generally limiting focus to the implications for the electricity network. In this paper, we aim to provide insight on the wider energy system impacts of the expected EV rollout in the UK, in terms of fuel changes, energy costs, CO2 emission reduction and network investments; and how different EV charging strategies increase or mitigate the impacts of the expected large-scale penetration of EVs. Results show that non-smart and/or decentralised charging will require considerably larger investments on the network to accommodate new EV demand. Network reinforcement costs are passed to the consumer via increased electricity prices and, albeit reduced, emissions shift from the transport to the power sector. These results show the importance of considering the whole energy system and the wider economy, to avoid carbon leakage and to maximise the effectiveness of policies.},

In this article, we investigate the future trajectory of AFOLU GHG emissions in Latin America, with and without efforts to mitigate, using a multi-model comparison approach. We find significant uncertainty in future emissions with and without climate policy. This uncertainty is due to differences in a variety of assumptions including (1) the role of bioenergy, (2) where and how bioenergy is produced, (3) the availability of afforestation options in climate mitigation policy, and (4) N2O and CH4 emission intensity. With climate policy, these differences in assumptions can lead to significant variance in mitigation potential, with three models indicating reductions in AFOLU GHG emissions and one model indicating modest increases in AFOLU GHG emissions.},

However, long-term climatic changes may affect the role of hydropower in meeting energy and climate policy objectives. The effects of climate change on runoff availability for hydropower generation are largely uncertain. This paper uses climate change scenarios derived from a large ensemble of Global Circulation Models as input for an energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) to examine least-cost options for the hydropower-dominated Ecuadorian power system in the period to 2050. This is done in the context of three policy cases in order to assess trade-offs between power system configuration, emissions and costs. The results show that in the long-term hydropower will remain as one of the most cost-effective and low emission technologies in the Ecuadorian power sector. However, constraints on deployment and uncertainty around climate change impacts could hinder its ability to contribute to the fulfilment of NDC targets, as well as create uncertainty around long-term power system costs. Strategies to hedge against these risks will likely require that hydropower expansion be complemented by alternative sources, namely incremental shares of thermoelectric generation with natural gas, biomass and geothermal energy.},

Results indicate that half the effort required to reach the updated 55% emissions reduction target should come from electricity decarbonisation, followed by transport. Alongside a post-COVID return to normal, the European Green Deal may lead to increased carbon prices and fossil-fuel rebounds, but these risks may be mitigated by certain behavioural changes, gains from which in transport energy use would outweigh associated consumption increases in the residential sector. Finally, the EU recovery mechanism could deliver about half the required investments needed to deliver on the 2030 ambition.},

Surveys identify householder energy system and participation preferences, alongside energy expert input on social equity and policy design. Scenario building is undertaken to compare energy system outcomes between the strategic Japanese policy approach and a user driven approach to energy transition, both cognizant of 2050 environmental goals. Both scenarios are comparatively assessed using a holistic sustainability evaluation process. Conclusions identify the impact of liberalization and subsequent householder participation in the energy system in Japan, when compared to a strategic, policy driven approach. Both approaches have positive ramifications on social equity and policy burden distribution outcomes. However, the household participation scenario delivers a more equitable outcome, distributing energy policy burdens in a fairer manner through the realization of an energy system which is safe, stable and affordable. The findings have practical applications in participatory policy design, and the development of energy policy which can achieve transition goals while being sensitive to householder preferences and social equity concerns.},

The agent-based model that will be developed is expected to interface with Forecast, by explicitly exploring how the decisions of individual households {\^{a}} in interaction, with others and intermediaries {\^{a}} affect these market shares.. We explore the connections of the models and provide input to the survey design. The document is structured as follows. Section 2 describes existing efforts in energy demand modelling and extracts key components that need to be taken into account in the CHEETAH modelling work. Section 3 describes existing agent-based models in order to draw lessons for the modelling work in CHEETAH. Section 4 includes conclusions on the most important findings and the lessons we draw for the design of the survey. This section presents also an overview of how the models in CHEETAH will be connected.},

We simulated possible pathways to meeting 2030 and 2050 emission targets within the Japanese electricity supply sector using a single-region model in The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES). Critically, our simulations incorporate novel technologies like hydrogen electrolysers, carbon capture, photochemical water splitting, and emerging photovoltaic cells, assess long-term impacts up to the year 2100, and include life-cycle emissions and learning curves for parameters such as investment cost, efficiency, and emission coefficients. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, using nuclear power and hydrogen from renewable energy-based electrolysis, is cost-effective and provides long-term emission reduction along with energy security. Nuclear, wind, solar, and hydrogen from renewables emerge as key emission reduction technologies, while natural gas with carbon capture plays a minor role in achieving emission reduction targets.},

This paper presents a new energy systems model for the Southern Cone region of Latin America, covering five regions (Argentina, Bolivia, South and Centre Chile, North Chile, and Brazil) with the aim to explore, up to 2030, the interplay between (i) the expected consumption of natural gas for electricity generation and end-use consumption (i.e. residential, commercial, transport and industry) in each country, (ii) the inter- and intra-country potential role as producer and consumer of natural gas, and (iii) the possible supply network of LNG and natural gas via pipeline and domestic production. It is found that, under a Constrained Investment Scenario, the gross domestic gas production of the Southern Cone from 2012 to 2030 could be 62 Tcf, whereas under an Unconstrained Scenario, it could rise to 75 Tcf. This highlights the economic potential of the unconventional gas resources of Argentina and projections of associated gas from the Campos and Santos basins in Brazil. However, accessing these resources poses financial challenges. Nonetheless, results clearly indicate significant potential for an increase in regional natural gas trade in the Southern Cone.},

abstract = {The natural gas exports from Argentina to Chile until the last decade represented a milestone for the energy integration aspirations in South America. Since the interruptions of Argentinian gas flows to Chile in 2004, this regional gas trade has been substituted by LNG imports. In 2016, Chile even started delivering gas to Argentina sourced by its LNG regasification terminals. However, tapping into unconventional gas resources in Argentina can reshape the supply-demand balance for these two countries. This study analysed the interplay between LNG and unconventional gas under two scenarios of investments in upstream supported by an integrated modelling tool for gas and power. In the Low-Investment Scenario in upstream, LNG imports increase significantly making it necessary to double the regasification capacity of Argentina by 2030. In the High-Investment scenario, where unconventional gas represents nearly half of natural gas domestic production in 2030, Argentina will rely on LNG only to meet winter demands. For Chile, in both scenarios tested, LNG remains relevant, requiring the construction of new regasification terminals. Still, developing unconventional resources as in the High-Investment scenario allows Argentina to re-take exports to Chile in the next decade, mainly in the summer season, providing another opportunity for discussions on energy integration in the region.},

abstract = {In this paper MARKAL-MACRO, an integrated energy-environment-economy model, is used to generate China's reference scenario for future energy development and carbon emission through the year 2050. The results show that with great efforts on structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement and energy substitution, China's primary energy consumption is expected to be 4818 Mtce and carbon emission 2394 MtC by 2050 with annual decrease rate of 3% for the carbon intensity per GDP during the period 2000-2050. On the basis of this reference scenario, China's marginal abatement cost curves of carbon for the year 2010, 2020 and 2030 are derived from the model, and the impacts of carbon emission abatement on GDP are also simulated. The results are compared with those from other sources. The research shows that the marginal abatement costs vary from 12US$/tC to 216US$/tC and the rates of GDP losses relative to reference range from 0.1% to 2.54% for the reduction rates between 5% and 45%. Both the marginal abatement costs and the rates of GDP losses further enlarge on condition that the maximum capacity of nuclear power is constrained to 240 GW or 160 GW by 2050. The paper concludes that China's costs of carbon abatement is rather high in case of carbon emissions are further cut beyond the reference scenario, and China's carbon abatement room is limited due to her coal-dominant energy resource characteristic. As economic development still remains the priority and per capita income as well as per capita carbon emission are far below the world average, it will be more realistic for China to make continuous contributions to combating global climate change by implementing sustainable development strategy domestically and playing an active role in the international carbon mitigation cooperation mechanisms rather than accepting a carbon emission ceiling. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The global climate change issue is becoming more and more important and hence to be the fourth challenge for China's future energy development, following energy supply shortages, energy security, and local environmental protection. This paper used three MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) family models, that is, MARKAL, MARKAL-ED (MARKAL with elastic demand), and MARKAL-MACRO, to study China energy system's carbon mitigation strategies and corresponding impacts on the economy. The models' structures and the economic feedback formulations used in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED are briefly described. The endogenous demands in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED enable them to partly satisfy carbon abatement constraints via energy service demand reductions, and the reduction levels for the 30 demand sectors from these two kinds of models for given carbon emission constraints are presented and compared. The impact of carbon mitigation on social welfare from MARKAL and MARKAL-ED, and on GDP, investment and consumption from MARKAL-MACRO are evaluated. The changes in both final and primary energy mix, changes in technology development, as well as marginal abatement costs for given carbon constraints from the three models, are analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also the most energy intensive industrial sector in China, accounting for 16.1% of total energy consumption in 2010. To assess energy consumption and CO2 emissions from China's steel industry, a system dynamics model and a bottom-up energy system model-TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) were used to analyze steel demand, energy consumption and CO2 emissions from China's iron and steel industry from 2010 to 2050. The model results suggest that steel production in China will rise from 627 Mt in 2010, to a peak of 772 Mt in 2020, and then gradually decrease to 527 Mt in 2050. The share of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel production will also increase significantly from 9.8% in 2010, to 45.6% in 2050. With the deployment of energy conservation technologies, such as Coke Dry Quenching, exhaust gas and heat recovery equipment, energy intensity and CO2 intensity of steel production will keep decreasing during the modeling period. In the near future, reductions in energy intensity and CO2 intensity will rely more on energy efficiency improvements; however, from a long-term perspective, structural change-the increasing share of EAF steel production, will be of great significance.},

In this chapter, multiple approaches, including the stock-based model, the saturation model, the discrete choices model, and so on, are used to project energy service demands from different demand sectors. The projections of energy service demand are used as inputs in the China TIMES-ED model to generate a reference scenario. Several carbon constraint scenarios have been designed to analyze the role of energy service demand reductions in industry, building and transport in the mitigation of carbon emissions in China.},

Ireland is an interesting case study due to the role of agriculture (a particularly challenging sector with regard to GHG emissions reduction), that represents 29% of Ireland's GHG emissions compared with less than 10% for the EU. The analysis is carried out with the Irish TIMES model, a bottom-up energy systems modelling tool with detailed characterization of Ireland's energy system. The paper uses scenario analysis to provide pathways that demonstrate how Ireland can meet the non-ETS target at least cost. The paper considers the impacts (in terms of different technology choices and higher marginal abatement costs) arising from higher targets for the energy system to compensate for growth in agriculture activity and low mitigation potential in that sector. The results point to a need to reconsider Ireland's renewable energy focus, with a need for increased effort in renewable transport and renewable heat in particular. The results also point to significant electrification of residential heating. The results also point to a high marginal abatement cost (€213/tCO2), which challenges the analysis carried out at EU level to establish Ireland's non-ETS target. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we have tried to investigate the current design (operational mechanism) of the policy, to examine the reasons for its problems, and to quantitatively predict future outlook. For the examination and prediction, we use the bottom-up model approach, which has not been commonly used for the RPS policy but is usually utilized for evaluating specific policy options in an energy system. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is not only to introduce a new approach for the exploration of the RPS policy, a scenario-based quantitative analysis based on a bottom-up energy system model, but also to apply the approach into the policy in Korea. We develop a multi-regional bottom-up energy model and explicitly implement the mechanism of the policy in the model, such as the transfer of tradable attribute - Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). The results of the model predict a serious disharmony of the current design of the policy under the national basic plan; the optimistic fulfillment rate of RECs in the entire mechanism will be around 66% in 2022, so the most regulated generators will suffer from the large shortfalls of RECs and the total penalty for all regulated generators will be expected up to 1350 billion KRW in 2022. We also diagnose the reasons of the disharmony as well as address some suggestions for its continued application. As the Korean case study, we believe that the approach in this study can be utilized when policy makers design or amend the mechanism of RPS with RECs to help the policy operate efficiently and to prevent potential undesirable consequences.},

The scenarios were defined in terms of three perspectives: the development level of key technologies, contribution of future renewable energy to the power generation sector, and relative importance of each hydrogen production method portfolio. All scenarios were based on the policies being considered by the Korean government. The results of the scenario analyses show, among others, that green hydrogen, i.e., water electrolysis-oriented hydrogen production, consumes a fairly large amount of electricity. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire national energy system, the transition of the power sector to renewable energy, mainly solar and wind energies, and the advancement of water electrolysis are required to reduce the national GHG emissions.},

Our proposed method may guide industry to proactively prepare for the possible effects of different energy policies on their current product/process systems environmental profile so that they can make strategic decisions on modifications to, and investments in their production processes thereby to enhance their environmental- and economic-performance while meeting the various emission-abatement targets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As a member, South Korea has already proposed the reduction target and need to submit the achievement as a result of the policies and endeavors in the near future. In this paper, a Korean bottom-up energy system model to support the low-carbon national energy R & D roadmap will be introduced and through the modeling of various scenarios, the mid-to long-term impact on energy consumptions and CO2 emissions will be analyzed as well. The results of the analysis showed that, assuming R & D investments for the 11 types of technologies, savings of 13.7% with regards to final energy consumptions compared to the baseline scenario would be feasible by 2050. Furthermore, in the field of power generation, the generation proportion of new and renewable energy is expected to increase from 3.0% as of 2011 to 19.4% by 2050. This research also suggested that the analysis on the Energy Technology R & D Roadmap based on the model can be used not only for overall impact analysis and R & D portfolio establishment, but also for the development of detailed R & D strategies.},

abstract = {Background: This work explores the potential contribution of bioenergy technologies to 60% and 80% carbon reductions in the UK energy system by 2050, by outlining the potential for accelerated technological development of bioenergy chains. The investigation was based on insights from MARKAL modelling, detailed literature reviews and expert consultations. Due to the number and complexity of bioenergy pathways and technologies in the model, three chains and two underpinning technologies were selected for detailed investigation: (1) lignocellulosic hydrolysis for the production of bioethanol, (2) gasification technologies for heat and power, (3) fast pyrolysis of biomass for bio-oil production, (4) biotechnological advances for second generation bioenergy crops, and (5) the development of agro-machinery for growing and harvesting bioenergy crops. Detailed literature searches and expert consultations (looking inter alia at research and development needs and economic projections) led to the development of an 'accelerated' dataset of modelling parameters for each of the selected bioenergy pathways, which were included in five different scenario runs with UK-MARKAL (MED). The results of the 'accelerated runs' were compared with a low-carbon (LC-Core) scenario, which assesses the cheapest way to decarbonise the energy sector. Results: Bioenergy was deployed in larger quantities in the bioenergy accelerated technological development scenario compared with the LC-Core scenario. In the electricity sector, solid biomass was highly utilised for energy crop gasification, displacing some deployment of wind power, and nuclear and marine to a lesser extent. Solid biomass was also deployed for heat in the residential sector from 2040 in much higher quantities in the bioenergy accelerated technological development scenario compared with LC-Core. Although lignocellulosic ethanol increased, overall ethanol decreased in the transport sector in the bioenergy accelerated technological development scenario due to a reduction in ethanol produced from wheat. Conclusion: There is much potential for future deployment of bioenergy technologies to decarbonise the energy sector. However, future deployment is dependent on many different factors including investment and efforts towards research and development needs, carbon reduction targets and the ability to compete with other low carbon technologies as they become deployed. All bioenergy technologies should become increasingly more economically competitive with fossil-based technologies as feedstock costs and flexibility are reduced in line with technological advances. {\textcopyright} 2009 Clarke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper provides perspectives on the role of Latin American and Latin American countries in meeting global abatement goals, based on the scenarios developed through the CLIMACAP–LAMP modeling study. Abatement potential in Latin America, among other things, is influenced by its development status, the large contributions of non-CO2 and land use change CO2 emissions, and energy endowments. In most scenarios in this study, the economic potential to reduce fossil fuel CO2 as well as non-CO2 emissions in Latin America in 2050 is lower than in the rest of the world (in total) when measured against 2010 emissions, due largely to higher emission growth in Latin America than in the rest of the world in the absence of abatement. The potential to reduce land use change CO2 emissions is complicated by a wide range of factors and is not addressed in this paper (land use emissions are largely addressed in a companion paper). The study confirms the results of previous research that the variation in abatement costs across models may vary by an order of magnitude or more, limiting the value of these assessments and supporting continued calls for research on the degree to which models are effectively representing key local circumstances that influence costs and available abatement options. Finally, a review of policies in place in several Latin American countries at the time of this writing finds that they would be of varying success in meeting the emission levels proposed by the most recent IPCC reports to limit global temperature change to 2 °C.},

abstract = {It is anticipated that the decarbonisation of the entire energy system will require the introduction of large shares of variable renewable electricity generation into the power system. Long term integrated energy systems models are useful in improving our understanding of decarbonisation but they struggle to take account of short term variations in the power system associated with increased variable renewable energy penetration. This can oversimplify the ability of power systems to accommodate variable renewables and result in mistaken signals regarding the levels of flexibility required in power systems. Capturing power system impacts of variability within integrated energy system models is challenging due to temporal and technical simplifying assumptions needed to make such models computationally manageable. This paper addresses a gap in the literature by reviewing prominent methodologies that have been applied to address this challenge and the advantages & limitations of each. The methods include soft linking between integrated energy systems models and power systems models and improving the temporal and technical representation of power systems within integrated energy systems models. Each methodology covered approaches the integration of short term variations and assesses the flexibility of the system differently. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of these different methodologies are analysed. This review allows users of integrated energy systems models to select a methodology (or combination of methodologies) to suit their needs. In addition, the analysis identifies remaining gaps and shortcomings.},

abstract = {This work presents three 25-year energy scenarios developed with the TIMES model generator for Pesaro, a seaside municipality in central Italy. It evaluates the effectiveness of local-scale energy policies in three sectors: households, transport, and the public sector (PS). Since the local energy demand is affected by summer tourism, seasonal consumption by holiday homes was also studied. Three scenarios were hypothesized: Business as Usual (BAU), Exemplary Public Sector (EPS), and Exemplary Municipality (EM). The EPS scenario models the exemplary role that recent European directives attribute to the PS in setting energy efficiency and technology penetration targets for itself; the EM scenario extends these targets to the household sector. In particular, the study underscores the potential of micro-cogeneration technologies in achieving local environmental targets, even though their diffusion would involve an increase in local energy consumption due to internalization of the primary energy used to produce electricity, which would no longer be wholly imported from outside municipal boundaries. The study provides information to local decision-makers by estimating the cost of implementing a number of energy policies. Finally, the study discusses the adequacy of TIMES as a tool to analyse municipal-scale scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This work analyzes the public administration's role in energy and climate policies by assessing carbon-lowering measures for properties and services managed directly by local governments in central Italy. Both short- and long-term schemes were considered in the analysis of local authority energy strategies. The MARKAL-TIMES energy model was applied to long-term energy planning to assess the effect of low-carbon initiatives on public-sector energy consumption up to 2030. Two energy scenarios were built, i.e. a Business As Usual (BAU) scenario based on current or soon-to-be-adopted national policies, and an Exemplary Public Scenario (EPS) including some further virtuous local policies suggested by local authorities. Our results show that a 20% primary energy reduction can be achieved with respect to the baseline year by means of short-term energy policies (5-year time span), while a primary energy saving of about 30% can be reached with longer-term energy policies (25-year time span), even after taking the increase in energy demand into account.

abstract = {This study investigates the potential of energy efficiency, renewables, and micro-cogeneration to reduce household consumption in a medium Italian town and analyses the scope for municipal local policies. The study also investigates the effects of tourist flows on town's energy consumption by modelling energy scenarios for permanent and summer homes. Two long-term energy scenarios (to 2030) were modelled using the MarkAL-TIMES generator model: BAU (business as usual), which is the reference scenario, and EHS (exemplary household sector), which involves targets of penetration for renewables and micro-cogeneration. The analysis demonstrated the critical role of end-use energy efficiency in curbing residential consumption. Cogeneration and renewables (PV (photovoltaic) and solar thermal panels) were proven to be valuable solutions to reduce the energetic and environmental burden of the household sector (-20% in 2030). Because most of household energy demand is ascribable to space-heating or hot water production, this study finds that micro-CHP technologies with lower power-to-heat ratios (mainly, Stirling engines and microturbines) show a higher diffusion, as do solar thermal devices. The spread of micro-cogeneration implies a global reduction of primary energy but involves the internalisation of the primary energy, and consequently CO2 emissions, previously consumed in a centralised power plant within the municipality boundaries. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The analysis is based on the Baseline and Alternative scenario results, where hydrogen reaches a significant share. The two scenarios constitute the starting points to analyse the hydrogen potential among the possible energy policy options. The energy demand in the Baseline scenario reaches values around 240 Mtoe at 2030, with an average annual growth of 0.9%. The Alternative scenario reduces consumption down to 220 Mtoe and stabilizes the CO2 emissions. The Alternative scenario expects a rapid increase of hydrogen vehicles in 2030, up to 2.5 million, corresponding to 1 Mtoe of hydrogen consumption.

We address the lack of an existing integrated tool by developing a technology-rich, bottom-up model for the region. The goal of this paper is twofold: we present the model and its functioning and then we analyse a cost-optimal way to reach the −55% regional target. Firstly, we describe the methodology, discussing how we build the sectors of our model and how the optimisation works. Secondly, we run the model with a constraint on GHG emissions to assess the impact of the mitigation target. We show that the total system cost of such an ambitious mitigation scenario is only ∼0.5% higher than the cost of an unconstrained reference scenario and that emissions reduction must start as soon as possible to stay on the cost-effective trajectory. Concerning technologies, windmills, photovoltaic (PV) panels and building renovations are cost-optimal solutions even with high discount rates.},

abstract = {Sustainability of energy systems requires drastic changes of production and consumption standards, in order to fulfil energy and material demand with a lower quantity of resources and to reduce the whole impacts including also the environmental damages caused by the human activities. The internalisation of external costs in the pricing system can actually drive consumers' behaviour towards sustainable choices and life standards. In the last 20 years a great interest of the scientific community has been devoted to identify and monetarise the damages on human health and on environment caused by energy-related activities and to give guidance for supporting the design of internalisation measures. First studies on these issues were carried out at the beginning of the nineties, in the framework of the EU-funded ExternE project and dealt with an assessment of the externalities from a wide range of different fuel cycles (nuclear, fossil fuels, renewable sources). The ExternE methodology has been further improved, validated and extended in the framework of the NewExt, ExternE-Pol and in the NEEDS projects. At the same time, energy system analysis, developed since the late seventies in response to the oil crisis, has been further extended to include environmental issues and more specific economic evaluations. A major role in this framework, has been played by the MARKAL/TIMES family of models developed by IEA-ETSAP, largely utilised worldwide to support decision makers in understanding and planning the future behaviour of energy systems, over a medium-long term period. Starting from a detailed technology- economic-environmental characterisation of the analysed energy system, from demand to supply side, the MARKAL/TIMES based models identify the optimal configuration on the time horizon considered, in compliance with exogenous constraints (resources availability, pollutants reduction, etc.). Based on this background research, the integration of energy system analysis methods with externalities assessments represents a powerful tool to support a systemic multi-objective investigation, aimed at achieving a better resource management as well as at reducing environmental pollution. This chapter is addressed to describe, from a methodological and an operating point of view, how strategic energy planning can benefit from external costs evaluation. Thus an applicative example is provided, presenting the main results obtained for the integrated Italy energy model are presented and the same general conclusions for policy guidelines are derived.},

However, their diffusion requires huge capital investment and major infrastructure changes, which have to be assessed to verify their effectiveness. The article present an application of the R-MARKAL model to investigate the feasibility of renewable use on a local case study for electricity and thermal energy production. A comprehensive modelling approach is used to emphasise the relationships and feedback between conversion and demand sectors (residential, services and commercial), taking into account contemporaneously legal issues and physical limits of the system. The model's solutions represent the minimum cost choice and the results show that even in absence of exogenous environmental constraints, many renewable technologies are profitable demand device and their investment costs are paid off in a medium term by lower operating and maintenance expenditures. In this context the use of thermal energy from incinerator allows one to achieve a consistent reduction of atmospheric pollutant emissions and, particularly, of greenhouse gases emissions due to waste degradation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To analyse different decarbonization pathways for the energy system, existing models have traditionally focused on specific energy sectors, adopted specific research perspectives, assessed only certain technologies, or studied isolated components and factors of the energy system. However, few efforts have been undertaken to successfully model a broader picture of the energy-economic system. In this conceptual paper, we propose linking top-down and bottom-up models to represent: distributed generation and demand, operations of electricity grids, infrastructure investments and generation dispatch, and macroeconomic interactions. We review existing work on modelling the different dimensions of the energy transition to understand why models tend to focus on certain features or parts of the energy system. We then discuss methodologies for linking different type of models. We describe our integrated modelling framework, and the challenges and opportunities on linking models based on their capabilities and limitations.},

The E3MG, with the UK as one of its regions, combines a top-down approach for modeling the global economy and for estimating the aggregate and disaggregate energy demand and a bottom-up approach (Energy Technology subModel, ETM) for simulating the power sector, which then provides feedback to the energy demand equations and the whole economy. The ETM submodel uses a probabilistic approach and historical data for estimating the penetration levels of the different technologies, considering their economic, technical and environmental characteristics. Three pathway scenarios (CFH, CLC and CAM) simulate the CO2 reduction by 40%, 60% and 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels respectively and are compared with a reference scenario (REF), with no reduction target. The targets are modeled as the UK contribution to an international mitigation effort, such as achieving the G8 reduction targets, which is a more realistic political framework for the UK to move towards deep reductions rather than moving alone. This paper aims to provide modeling evidence that deep reduction targets can be met through different carbon pathways while also assessing the macroeconomic effects of the pathways on GDP and investment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

GEP is a complex task, combining techno-economic, financial, spatial and environmental characteristics. Several models are developed to model GEP, applying different methodological approaches. The underlying theory is very important as it might inherit bias in the resulted outcomes. The debate on the appropriateness of each methodology is increased, especially as projected outlooks deviate from reality.

This study uses two newly developed global top-down and bottom-up models with a regional China focus to compare China's future energy and CO2 emission pathways toward 2050. By harmonizing the economic and demographic trends as well as a carbon tax pathway, we explore how both models respond to these identical exogenous inputs. Then a soft-linking methodology is applied to "narrow the gap" between the results computed by these models. We find for example that without soft-linking, China's baseline CO2 emissions might range from 15-20 Gt in 2050, while soft-linking models results in 17 Gt. Reasons for the results gap between the models are discussed subsequently, such as model structure and statistical inputs. At a sectoral level, the gap can be mainly traced to China's future coal use in electricity production. The study finds that it is beneficial to soft-link complex global models under harmonized assumptions. Although this study fails to "close the gap" between the two models completely, the experiences and insights shared here will be beneficial for researchers and policy makers that are drawing conclusions from the results of China and global scenario studies.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, analyzing issues within the ‘water-energy nexus' has become a topic of increasing attention for the scientific and policy communities. Based on an extensive survey of recent scientific literature on the water-energy nexus, 70 studies were identified and 35 were selected as comprehensive case studies for review. The reviewed studies were classified and assessed according to groupings based on both geographic scale and their ‘nexus scope'. In addition to providing a depository summary of a wide range of current existing methods and tools for water-energy nexus analysis, the paper discusses these approaches based on their main purposes. From this review, it is clear that the research on water-energy nexus has seen a significant increase in both the number of studies and the capacity of the scientific community to productively assess water and energy interlinkages at a higher resolution. At the same time, this review has also concluded that, while many studies aim to develop new methods and frameworks to comprehensively assess interactions between water, energy and other elements, none can or do provide a singular framework for performing a “nexus study”. Furthermore, many researches are at the “understanding” stage with an emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the water-energy nexus. Fewer approaches are designed to support governance and implementation of technical solutions, and this is considered to a priority challenge area for the scientific community if it aims to achieve greater impact on resource policy and management. There is a clear need to improve our ability to classify and compare the capacities, strengths and weaknesses between existing approaches. This would better enable a wider group of stakeholders to utilize existing knowledge to improve their effective management of water and energy resources. It could also help focus the scientific community to more effectively improve upon the existing knowledge base and to increase focus on “governing” and “implementing” the nexus.},

The CO2 emission reduction targets and limiting the use of imported fossil fuels put a strain on the fuel mixture planning of electricity sector. In this study, least cost electricity generation based on various fuel mixtures with and without external costs are determined while achieving an optimal solution for emission reduction targets or keeping the fuel share as it was in the base year (business as usual, BAU). The optimization is developed between 2016 and 2035 using ANSWER-TIMES energy planning simulation program taking 2015 as the base year. The results show that by internalizing external costs renewable energy power plants are promoted in long term. The fossil fueled power plants are primarily preferred to meet the demand when the external costs of electricity generation are not considered during optimization. The scenario results also presented that the total discounted costs increase by 4% for CO2 mitigation scenario relative to BAU scenario when external costs are not considered in optimization. However, total discounted system costs are increased by about 30% for both CO2 mitigation and BAU scenarios when external costs are considered in optimization. The scenario results also presented that the CO2 emissions can be reduced by about 30% when optimizations are performed considering the external costs and emission targets.},

With the integrated assessment model TIAM-ECN we project how large its contribution could be in Europe in the power sector and industry, and analyze how this contribution may be affected by cost decline (driven by technological innovation) and ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. If Europe stays on track of achieving zero net emissions by mid-century, we find that CO2 capture activities in Europe may grow to a total amount of some 1700 MtCO2/yr in 2050. We project that by 2050 power plants equipped with CCS could contribute by approximately 25 % to total electricity generation, in competition with low-carbon alternatives such as nuclear energy and renewables like solar photovoltaic and wind power. CCS in association with the use of natural gas could account for about 35 % of energy use in industrial applications, while the use of biomass and coal combined with CCS could be employed for the production of hydrogen. We find that stringent climate policy measures constitute a bigger driver of broad CCS diffusion than CCS technology cost reductions. We project that under stringent climate policy targeting zero net emissions by 2050, a 30 % CCS capital cost reduction as a result of technological advancement could proffer Europe by the middle of the century a saving of about 17 billion US$/yr in additional energy system costs.},

abstract = {Supporting investments in energy efficiency is considered a robust strategy to achieve a successful transition to low-carbon energy systems in line with the Paris Agreement. Increased energy efficiency levels are expected to reduce the need for supply-side investments in controversial technologies, such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear energy, and to induce a downward push on carbon prices, which may facilitate the political and societal acceptance of climate policies, without adversely affecting living comfort and sustainable development. In order to fully reap these potential benefits, economies need to design policy packages that balance emission reduction incentives on both the demand and the supply side. In this paper we carry out a model-comparison exercise, using two well-established global integrated assessment models, PROMETHEUS and TIAM-ECN, to quantitatively analyze the global system-level effects of increased energy efficiency in the context of ambitious post-COVID climate change mitigation scenarios. Our results confirm the expected benefits induced by higher energy efficiency levels, as in 2050 global carbon prices are found to decline by 10%–50% and CO2 storage from CCS plants is 13%–90% lower relative to the “default” mitigation scenarios. Similarly, enhanced energy efficiency reduces the additional average yearly system costs needed globally in 2050 to achieve emission reductions in line with the Paris Agreement. These additional costs are estimated to be of the order of 2 trillion US$ – or 1% of global GDP – in a well-below-2 °C scenario, and can be reduced by 6–30% with the adoption of higher energy efficiency standards. While the two models project broadly consistent future trends for the energy mix in the various scenarios, the effects may differ in magnitude due to intrinsic differences in how the models are set up and how sensitive they are to changes in energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.},

With the updated version of TIAM-ECN, we quantify how large the share of geothermal energy in Europe could grow until 2050, and analyze how this expansion could be stimulated by climate policy and technological progress. We investigate geothermal energy's two main applications: power and heat production. For the former, we project an increase to around 100–210 TWh/yr in 2050, depending on assumptions regarding climate ambition and cost reductions for enhanced geothermal resource systems. For the latter, with applications in residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, we anticipate under the same assumptions a rise to about 880–1050 TWh/yr in 2050. We estimate that by the middle of the century geothermal energy plants could contribute approximately 4–7% to European electricity generation. We foresee a European geothermal energy investment market (supply plus demand side) possibly worth about 160–210 billion US$/yr by mid-century.},

abstract = {In this paper Kenya's climate change mitigation ambitions are analysed from an energy system perspective, with a focus on the role of renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies. At COP-21 in 2015 in Paris, Kenya has committed to a ‘nationally determined contribution' of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2030 in comparison to a business-as-usual projection. An efficient exploitation of the country's renewable energy resources is key to achieving this target. We use the TIAM-ECN model to characterize plausible development pathways for the Kenyan energy mix until 2050 under different climate change mitigation scenarios. We conclude that the power sector can expand with mostly renewable energy options even in the absence of stringent greenhouse gas abatement targets. On the contrary, on the demand side a substantial deployment of low-carbon technologies is triggered only when ambitious emission reduction objectives are in place. The introduction of these technologies entails additional energy system costs, ranging in 2050 from 0.5% to 2% of the country's GDP. Our analysis supports the feasibility of Kenyan climate management goals, provided that adequate investments in renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies are timely made available.},

This is achieved by imposing a constraint on overall travel time in the system, which represents the empirically observed fixed travel time budget (TTB) of individuals, and introducing a cost for infrastructural investments (travel time investment, TTI), which reduces the travel time of public transport. Two case studies from California and Ireland are developed using a simple TIMES model, and results are generated to 2030 for a reference scenario, an investments scenario and a CO 2 emissions reduction scenario. The results show that with no travel time constraint, the model chooses public transport exclusively. With a travel time constraint, mode choice is determined by income and investment cost assumptions, and the level of CO 2 constraint, with greater levels of public transport in the mitigation scenario. At low travel investment cost, new rail is introduced for short distances and increased bus capacity for longer distances. At higher investment costs rail is increasingly chosen for long distances also.},

abstract = {The development of the energy system model IFE-TIMES-Norway started in 2017 in cooperation with Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). This report describes the model version 2 from November 2021, with several updates made throughout the model since previous model documentation (2020). The model is based on earlier versions of TIMES-Norway (2009) and MARKAL-Norway (1992). The model development is dynamic with continuously methodological developments. IFE-TIMES-Norway is a long-term optimisation model of the Norwegian energy system that is generated by TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) modelling framework. TIMES is a bottom-up framework that provides a detailed techno-economic description of resources, energy carriers, conversion technologies and energy demand. TIMES models provide investments and operational decisions that minimize the total discounted cost of a given energy system that meets the future demand for energy services. The total energy system cost includes investment costs in both supply and demand technologies, operation and maintenance costs, and income from electricity export to and costs of electricity import from countries outside Norway. IFE-TIMES-Norway is a technology-rich model of the Norwegian energy system that is divided into five regions that corresponds to the current spot price areas of the electricity market. The model provides operational and investment decisions from the starting year, 2018, towards 2050, with model periods for every fifth year from 2020 within this model horizon. To capture operational variations in energy generation and end-use, each model period is split into 96 sub-annual time slices, where four seasons is represented by 24 hours each. The model has a detailed description of end-use of energy, and the demand for energy services is divided into numerous end-use categories within industry, buildings and transport.},

This research designed scenarios to model the prospective influences of the liquid vehicles elimination using Global TIMES model. Results show that energy consumption and direct carbon emissions of global transport sector in prohibition scenarios are expected to decrease by 54.1% and 84.8% in 2050 compared to SSP2 and electrification rate of global transport sector may reach 60.5%. Cumulative direct carbon emissions of global transport sector can accomplish the RCP2.6 mitigation target, which is allocated to transport sector by the model, if the median prohibition time will be prior to 2035. Nevertheless, the RCP2.6 mitigation goal is not expected to be achieved considering the indirect emissions from the increasing electricity consumption in global transport. Therefore, the substitution of electric vehicles for liquid vehicles should be accompanied with the decarbonization of global power sector.},

The energy infrastructures in these counties are in the process of rapid development and, therefore, technology choices are critical. Applying the energy system model MARKAL and scenario analysis, this paper examines and quantifies the role of clean and advanced energy technologies for efficient local resource exploitation and improving energy security and environmental conditions. The main focus is on the power sector and the paper also addresses the potential ASEAN markets for European energy technologies. The paper concludes that there is a large potential market for clean and advanced energy technologies in the studied countries. If adopted, these technologies will bring several benefits like reduction in primary energy requirement, reduced investments requirement in the power sector and other parts of the energy infrastructure, reduced import of primary energy, reduced CO2 emissions and local pollution, reduced energy system costs and marginal cost of electricity supply. Finally, barriers for transfer and diffusion of advanced energy technologies are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bangladesh, currently a low middle-income economy aspires to become a high middle income country by 2021. To achieve such aspiration, the country will have to ensure adequate power supply for its fast growing economy. Bangladesh lacks energy resources for power generation. This paper explores some of the power supply scenarios with special focus on power imports and higher use of renewables. Using the technology rich, least cost optimization model ‘The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES)' the authors developed four possible future power supply scenarios for Bangladesh. These scenarios include an energy security framework (based on the Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2016 report), a high power import scenario, a scenario with higher use of renewables and a combined high power import - high renewables development scenario. The analysis indicates that the present energy security framework ensures energy security with diversifying fuels used for power generation, however, scenarios with high power imports and a high share of renewables (including the combined scenario) bring down the cost of supplying power along with a reduction in expensive fossil fuel imports while maintaining energy security as fuel sources for power generation still remain diversified.},

This is incorporated in an energy system planning model with high spatial and temporal resolution. An advanced bottom-up energy system modeling framework is used to develop the model. The North-Indian power sector is considered as a case study with the analysis of renewable energy penetration and curtailment levels, technology capacity, and role of storage and inter-regional energy exchange for many future energy transition scenarios. Various model cases indicate system transition towards high renewable energy penetrated generation portfolio. Solar energy curtailment is prominent in high renewable scenarios. Coal-based power plants are important generation options unless drastic high CO2 price is considered. Storage systems work as energy arbitrage devices. Quantifying intra-regional renewable energy capacity and generation potential and incorporating them in a long-term planning model with many annual time slices is a contribution to the current modeling practices. Analysis of varied sensitivity cases adds value to long-term large-scale variable renewable energy integration planning approaches.},

abstract = {Power system operational uncertainties of load fluctuation, and unplanned outage of generating units, or lines are normally handled by reserve generation or transmission capacity. The output of conventional generators is quite controllable, and load variation is predictable within a certain confidence limit. On the other hand, output of variable renewable generators is random and uncontrollable. Large-scale integration of these resources introduces additional uncertainty to an existing system. This drastic change in generation paradigm underscores the need for additional flexible capacity to maintain reliable system operation. Conventional long-term planning studies tend to overestimate system's ability to integrate renewable energy and underestimate flexibility requirement due to inherent modeling limitations. Mathematical models that are used in these planning exercises adopt simplified spatial and temporal resolution and often neglect real system operation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new planning strategies to reflect short-term renewable energy resource intermittency in long-term decision making. In this article, the implication of RE intermittency in system operation and also their impact on long-term planning is discussed. Recent planning approaches from literature which aim to address these issues, have been highlighted. A critical discussion regarding their usefulness is also presented.},

abstract = {The analysis in this paper builds on a previous China MARKAL modeling effort to further explore alternative energy-technology strategies and assess the extent to which they could enable China to meet its social and economic development goals while ensuring national energy-supply security and promoting environmental protection and sustainable development. The present analysis is intended to help sharpen the focus on key strategic issues, policies, and programs for promoting an advanced energy-technology strategy in general and coal polygeneration technology in particular. The detailed assessment of coal polygeneration technology is warranted because of its potentially central role in providing clean synthetic transportation fuels as well as electricity. The paper explores the following set of specific issues: (1) the costs and benefits of advanced energy-technology strategies compared to strategies based on coal combustion for electricity generation and direct coal liquefaction to produce liquid fuels, (2) the impact that delays in the introduction of polygeneration technologies might have on overall energy system costs and on meeting environmental and energy security goals, (3) the impact of future, crisis-induced oil price shocks, (4) the impact of insufficiently aggressive end-use energy efficiency efforts, and (5) the relative costs of achieving reductions in air pollution and CO2 emissions with different energy-technology strategies. The analysis indicates that an energy development strategy based on advanced technologies, including efficient end-use technologies, renewables, and coal gasification-based energy supply technologies, can enable China to meet economic development, clean air, energy security and greenhouse gas mitigation targets consistent with sustainable development. A "business-as-usual" strategy, even including direct coal liquids technology, cannot meet target caps on oil and gas imports. In addition, the analysis indicates that over the 55-year modeling period (1995 to 2050) an advanced technology strategy would involve only a small (1 %) increase in total energy-system cost compared with a "business-as-usual" strategy. The advanced technology strategy requires significantly higher capital investments in energy technologies, but these result in significantly lower fuel costs, especially from reduced fuel imports. {\textcopyright} 2003 International Energy Initiative, Inc.},

A multi-model approach is used to explore and rank alternative plans (combinations of actions and measures) towards the sustainable development of the municipality, with a particular focus on the residential and transport sectors. On the basis of the possible space of decisions of the municipality (which can be seen as "urban planner", as "regulator", as "provider of support and information", as "consumer" and as "supplier" of energy), alternative planning hypotheses have been prepared and tested making use of a city-energy system model and scenario analysis. Scenarios are built around different themes with the aim of exploring the potential benefits (or drawbacks) of the combination of specific "competitive" projects, actions, standards, targets. A reference development of the local system is assumed to be modified through six combinations of actions and measures aiming at representing six pillars of alternative pathways towards the sustainability. Figures below report the key themes and hypotheses taken into consideration in the planning exercise. Once the dynamic pictures of the urban system are produced (one per each alternative), a multi-criteria method is used to determine the ranking of the options, evaluated against a set of elements (technological, social, environmental, economic). This stage is still ongoing and will generate the whole dataset (weights, preference functions) required to rank the alternatives in the next few months. All these alternative strategies are designed with the involvement of the municipality of Cesena, to directly respond their needs of knowledge about potential impacts of different action plans. Compared to the existing city strategic energy action plans, the advantage of the outputs of this approach is the fact that multiple future energy scenarios are analysed and cross-compared and "integrated" strategies ranked.},

We apply the methodology and present and discuss the results. The motivation for this soft-linking is to provide a transfer of information from the power systems model strong points to the energy systems model and use this information to improve and develop understanding of energy systems model results. Part of this motivation is derived from a view that one specific energy modeling tool cannot address all aspects of the full energy system in great detail and greater insights and progress can be gained by drawing on the strengths of multiple modeling tools rather than trying to incorporate them all into one comprehensive model. The methodology takes an optimized generation portfolio for a specific year from an energy systems model and undertakes a detailed high resolution chronological simulation of the same portfolio in the power systems model with added degrees of technical detail. Results presented here show that in the absence of key technical constraints, an energy systems model can potentially undervalue flexible resources, underestimate wind curtailment and overestimate the use of baseload plant. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

System security is viewed here as a multidimensional systemic property of the entire energy system. The paper shows that the different dimensions of a secure energy system are correlated, and hence their behaviour cannot be explained solely by an understanding of the individual dimensions or by system elements in isolation. The implication of this is that a proper assessment of the security of a power system requires a combination of different techno-economic models. The paper develops a comprehensive multi-model approach for investigating energy security issues within power systems, and applies it to a case study focussing on the Italian power sector. The core research activity involves using an energy systems model of Italy (MONET) to build a dedicated power systems model (PLEXOS-IT) and then undertaking a soft-linking exercise between the two models. The purpose is to use PLEXOS-IT to investigate the system adequacy of the power system results produced by MONET for future possible energy system scenarios.},

abstract = {Energy-economy optimization models - encoded with a set of structured, self-consistent assumptions and decision rules - have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant MGA alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of MGA as an energy modeling technique. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper MARKAL integrated energy system model is applied to explore the impacts and opportunities for low emissions energy system development in Macedonia, identifying CO2 emission reduction policies and the cost of taking action. Two scenarios with different reduction target have been examined: higher ambition scenario where emissions are restricted to 10% above 1990 levels in 2021 and 2.5% in 2030, and moderate ambition scenario where emissions are restricted to 25% above 1990 levels in 2021 and 15% in 2030. In order to provide insights into the optimal timing of emission reductions, both of these cases have also been run under cumulative constraints, that is, rather than having the specified annual targets, there is a carbon "budget" set for 2015-2030 (44 Mt and 26 Mt for higher and moderate ambition cases, respectively), reflecting the same ambition as the above cases but providing flexibility to reduce emissions in the most cost-optimal way. The results show that most of the CO2 reductions are in the power generation sector, which is not surprising as this tends to be the most carbon intensive sector. The higher ambition case is considerably more expensive than the reference case, with costs 1.9% higher, while the increase under the moderate ambition case is 1%. Under a cumulative constraint, the additional costs are reduced to 1.5% and 0.6% respectively, highlighting the importance of the timing of action.},

abstract = {Recent US data indicate a clear and progressive decoupling of carbon emissions and energy intensity from economic growth. This is primarily a consequence of state and national environmental and energy policy actions, and secondarily a result of shifts in economic structure and increases in natural gas supplies. To assess future opportunities of proactive approaches to policy and investment, we analyze 20 sector-based actions at the national and subnational levels in the US that can narrow remaining national carbon emissions gaps by 2020 and beyond, while improving economic and energy efficiency in every sector. These actions are found to provide favorable returns on investment for job creation, energy and cost savings, and multiple measures of energy security. Selection and design of these new actions are based on evaluation of hundreds of policy options derived from facilitated, stakeholder and consensus-based development of comprehensive climate action planning in 20 states. They represent top issues of focus for policymakers, and serve as key drivers for new investment, collaboration, and governance approaches that are needed to integrate economic, energy, and environmental security in the US. This same general approach to planning and analysis is of value to other nations seeking similar benefits. Techniques for comprehensive, multi-objective, fully integrated, and collaborative systems of planning and analysis are important as a means for comprehensive security solutions. This also requires leadership at all levels of government, and a broadened view of national security.},

Among those covered by the scheme, this sector is one of the most exposed, since it is both highly CO2-intensive and relatively open to international trade. We also examine the robustness of these results to various assumptions: marginal abatement cost curve, trade and demand elasticities, as well as pass-through rates and updating of allocation rules, of which the latter two are scarcely debated. We conclude that for this sector, competitiveness losses are small. We prove this conclusion to be robust. Hence arguments against tightening the environmental stringency of the ETS in Phase II are not justified on grounds of competitiveness loss. Our systematic sensitivity analysis allows us to identify the important assumptions for each output variable. It turns out that pass-through rates and updating rules are significant, despite being often implicit and least debated in existing analyses. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on the role of a potential niche market for cars with a limited travel range and how this may affect overall deployment of alternative drivetrain technologies and fuel choice. The results show that assuming a market of substantial size for such short-range cars leads to technologies such as BEVs being deployed more readily.

Introducing a strong decarbonisation constraint, for instance, profoundly modifies the power sector, which is impacted by increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources. Long-term modelling tools working on different assumptions increasingly factor in these impacts, the assessment of which requires a clear description and categorization of the technical and economic choices for representing the tools in question. A new typology based on a literature review is presented for both power sector models and long-term models of the energy system. New comparing criteria focussing on the power sector's components are put forward, such as electricity storage and grid. An analysis carried out by means of this categorization on five chosen models shows that, up until now, energy modelling tools and power system tools have been designed to meet separate objectives and have not combined their advantages.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles have attracted the attention of India's policy makers as clean technology alternatives due to their multiple advantages like higher efficiency and lower air pollution in short to medium term and reduced CO2 emissions as electricity gets decarbonized in the long-run under low carbon scenarios. This paper uses an energy system model ANSWER-MARKAL to analyse the role of electric vehicles (EV) in India. The modelling assessment spans the period 2010 to 2050 and analyses future EV demand in India under three scenarios: i) a ‘Reference' scenario which includes the continuation of existing EV policies as outlined in India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC); ii) a ‘EV policy' scenario which, in line with India's INDCs, follows targeted supply-side push policies for EVs, but without the budget constraints; and iii) a ‘low carbon' scenario which uses an exogenous price for CO2 in line with the global target of 2 °C temperature stabilization. The scenarios analysis delineates penetration of EVs and their co-benefits as well as co-costs. The co-benefits relate to local air quality, national energy security and CO2 emissions in India whereas the co-costs (risks) are related to sourcing of raw materials for batteries and battery reprocessing and disposal. The findings show that: i) in the reference scenario, the EVs 2-wheelers will achieve a significant share by 2050. Electric 4-wheelers though would have a small share even in 2050; ii) EV push policies though lead to significant diffusion of electric 2- wheelers in India by 2030. These policies enhance diffusion of electric 4-wheelers only if financial incentives are sustained in the long-term, iii) the application of global carbon price on the Indian economy in the 2° C stabilization scenario increases competitiveness of EVs and results in near total share of electric 2-wheelers by 2030 and a sizable share of electric 4-wheelers by 2050. The high and rising carbon price in low carbon scenario cause deep decarbonisation of electricity and enables EVs to deliver deep cut in CO2 emissions. The results show asymmetry in the impacts of national and global policies on co-benefits from EV. The EV supply-push policies deliver moderate benefits vis-{\`{a}}-vis air pollution and energy security indicators but make insignificant contribution CO2 emissions reduction. On the other hand, the global carbon price in the global 2° C stabilization scenario delivers sizable co-benefits vis-{\`{a}}-vis all three indicators. This asymmetry reveal important policy insights: i) the policy sequencing is vital to gain co-benefits, ii) EV technology push policies are good for creating early domestic market for a clean vehicle technology but they may not deliver sizable co-benefits vis-{\`{a}}-vis CO2 emissions which are global externalities, and iii) implementing strong climate policies early would lead to EVs delivering high co-benefits, in case of India, vis-{\`{a}}-vis all three indicators.},

abstract = {Dependence on oil for transport is a concern for India's policymakers on three counts - energy security, local environment and climate change. Rapid urbanisation and accompanying motorisation has created some of the most polluting cities in India and rising demand for oil is leading to higher imports, besides causing more CO2 emissions. The government of India wants to achieve the climate goals through a sustainability approach that simultaneously addresses other environment and developmental challenges. This paper analyses a sustainable low carbon transport (SLCT) scenario based on sustainable strategies for passenger and freight mobility, vehicle technologies and fuel using global CO2 prices that correspond to 2°C global stabilisation target. The scenarios span from years 2010 to 2050 and are analysed using the energy system model-ANSWER MARKAL. The SLCT scenario has improved energy security (cumulative oil demand lower by 3100Mtoe), improved air quality (PM 2.5 emissions never exceed the existing levels) and the cumulative CO2 emissions are lower by 13billiontCO2 thereby showing that achieving development objectives with CO2 co-benefits is feasible.},

The teams also modeled the comprehensive scenario which included policy measures from individual scenarios. The paper concludes that all of the measures provide strong co-benefits in reducing air pollutants and CO2 emissions. The modeling results show that the increased energy efficiency of passenger and freight vehicles has the largest potential for reducing both CO2 and PM2.5 emissions.

Energy system analysis provides a sound methodology to assess energy needs, allowing to investigate the energy system behavior and to individuate the optimal energy-technology configurations for the achievement of strategic energy and environmental policy targets. In this framework, the estimation of future trends of exogenous variables such as energy demand has a fundamental importance to obtain reliable and effective solutions, contributing remarkably to the accuracy of models' input data. This study illustrates an application of regression analysis to predict energy demand trends in end use sectors. The proposed procedure is applied to characterize statistically the relationships between population and gross domestic product (independent variables) and energy demands of Residential, Transport and Commercial in order to determine the energy demand trends over a long-term horizon. The effectiveness of linear and nonlinear regression models for energy demand forecasting has been validated by classical statistical tests. Energy demand projections have been tested as input data of the bottom-up TIMES model in two applications (the TIMES-Basilicata and TIMES-Italy models) confirming the validity of the forecasting approach.},

In fact these models enable the users to perform a scenario analysis in order to explore the behaviour of energy system to boundary conditions variations. They are typically characterized by a huge amount of data which informative content is often not fully exploited. In this framework, multivariate statistical techniques (Cluster Analysis - CA and Principal Component Analysis - PCA) can represent a key tool to characterize data correlation structure and to point out the variables with the highest information content.

abstract = {This paper investigates the energy system of the Basilicata region (southern Italy) to highlight, through a scenario analysis, its possible future development in compliance with the European Commission's long-term vision. The IEA-ETSAP methodology was utilized to model and analyse the Basilicata energy system in a business-as-usual scenario, based on the assumptions of the 2010 Regional Energy and Environmental Policy Plan, and in two low-carbon scenarios, decarbonisation and high energy efficiency, which, in line with the long-term European strategy, foresee an 85% carbon dioxide emission reduction and a 20% energy efficiency increase in 2050. The results highlight that electricity production from renewable energy sources (in particular wind energy), strongly supported by the regional policy, goes beyond the Basilicata Regional Energy-Environmental Plan forecast, with a further increase in the decarbonisation scenarios. In addition, solar thermal and highly efficient technologies are adopted in commercial and residential end-use sectors. An additional 9% reduction in energy consumption is achieved in the high energy efficiency scenario by passive houses. The proposed approach shows the usefulness of a modelling framework typically used for national and supranational analyses to support regional authorities in their decision-making process to obtain results in line with the European and national strategies. Application to the Basilicata region shows the usefulness of a consolidated framework for policy assessment at a local scale to assess regional contribution to the achievement of national climate mitigation targets that tend towards climate neutrality.},

New dynamics are occurring with cities becoming vectors of sustainable development, through initiatives like the Covenant of Mayors. Innovative approaches and tools are required to support city development planning in compliance with climate change mitigation goals. City planning and management are typically addressed through a fragmented and silo approach, failing to capture the dynamics and complexity of a city energy system. Integrated energy system modelling tools are progressively incorporating increasing realism to enhance results quality and confidence. This paper demonstrates the effects of including household budget constraints in integrated energy system optimisation modelling on low carbon city pathways. The TIMES_EVORA model was used to characterize current and future city energy system, covering all its chain, from energy supply sectors (e.g. electricity production) to end use sectors (e.g. residential and transport). Optimal solutions for meeting {\'{E}}vora municipality (Portugal) 2030 greenhouse gases emissions targets were assessed, combining household budget constraints for the acquisition of more efficient technologies – from appliances to private vehicles. The results showed a decrease of hybrid vehicles ownership in 2030 and a consequent increase of diesel vehicles. The optimal model solution shows a persistence in the acquisition of highly efficient households' appliances and the deployment of additional PV systems to facilitate a reduction of the electricity generation CO2 footprint. This allows to offset the transport CO2 emission increase and provide benefits across all energy system. Improving the integration of behavioural or real-life aspects in energy system optimisation models allows further understanding of city energy systems dynamics and provide robust city decarbonization strategies design. Cities sustainable energy system and urban planning should include different agent's investment constraints in order to avoid technology deployment locking that can compromise cities sustainable pathways.},

However, few residential energy system models have been developed for the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region and they do not account for the key diversities of energy use within the sector. This paper addresses this gap by developing a new residential energy model for Nigeria—the most populous country in SSA. The model is then used to explore different energy transition scenarios for the sector. Results indicate that the final energy consumption of the rural households will reduce and that of the urban households will increase significantly by 2050 when compared to the base year levels. The results indicate that cooking remains the most energy-intensive end-use. Analysis of the scenarios reveals that realising Sustainable Development Goal number 7 in Nigeria will drastically reduce the final energy demand of the sector. The transition from fuelwood to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking will reduce indoor air pollutants considerably but will increase CO2 emissions by 2050. The results also indicate that including the cost of externalities in energy cost makes electricity and biogas more economically viable options for cooking. While the model results are insightful, the paper argues that robust and dedicated policies are needed for a sustainable energy transition of the Nigerian residential sector.},

abstract = {The accelerated growth in biofuel markets has both created and reinforced linkages between agriculture and energy. The evolution of biofuel markets over the next 10-20years and the implications for energy, agriculture, and the environment are uncertain. Building on an integrated agriculture-energy modeling framework, this study analyzes a baseline and three alternative scenarios: two scenarios based on energy prices (crude oil and natural gas) and one based on assumptions regarding cellulosic biomass availability. By examining the impact of scenarios driven by (a) changes in the energy sector and (b) changes in the agricultural sector, we can compare the differential effects on biofuels markets, commodity prices and quantities in each sector, and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Scenario comparisons show biofuel markets affected more by crude oil prices than natural gas prices. However, higher natural gas prices shift the biofuel production mix away from corn-grain based to more cellulosic ethanol via multiple mechanisms. Alternatively, the scenario with no cellulosic feedstock lowers total ethanol production and raises ethanol and corn prices. In terms of environmental impacts, higher ethanol levels driven by higher oil prices lead to lower CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. In comparison, the no cellulosic scenario results in the highest CO<inf>2</inf> trajectory relative to the baseline.},

abstract = {The UK government heat strategy is partially based on decarbonisation pathways from the UK MARKAL energy system model. We review how heat provision is represented in UK MARKAL, identifying a number of shortcomings and areas for improvement. We present a completely revised model with improved estimations of future heat demands and a consistent representation of all heat generation technologies. This model represents all heat delivery infrastructure for the first time and uses dynamic growth constraints to improve the modelling of transitions according to innovation theory. Our revised model incorporates a simplified housing stock model, which is used produce highly-refined decarbonisation pathways for residential heat provision. We compare this disaggregated model against an aggregated equivalent, which is similar to the existing approach in UK MARKAL. Disaggregating does not greatly change the total residential fuel consumption in two scenarios, so the benefits of disaggregation will likely be limited if the focus of a study is elsewhere. Yet for studies of residential heat, disaggregation enables us to vary consumer behaviour and government policies on different house types, as well as highlighting different technology trends across the stock, in comparison with previous aggregated versions of the model. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {One option to decarbonise residential heat in the UK is to convert the existing natural gas networks to deliver hydrogen. We review the technical feasibility of this option using semi-structured interviews underpinned by a literature review and we assess the potential economic benefits using the UK MARKAL energy systems model. We conclude that hydrogen can be transported safely in the low-pressure pipes but we identify concerns over the reduced capacity of the system and the much lower linepack storage compared to natural gas. New hydrogen meters and sensors would have to be fitted to every building in a hydrogen conversion program and appliances would have to be converted unless the government was to legislate to make them hydrogen-ready in advance. Converting the gas networks to hydrogen is a lower-cost residential decarbonisation pathway for the UK than those identified previously. The cost-optimal share of hydrogen is sensitive to the conversion cost and to variations in the capital costs of heat pumps and micro-CHP fuel cells. With such small cost differentials between technologies, the decision to convert the networks will also depend on non-economic factors including the relative performance of technologies and the willingness of the government to organise a conversion program. {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {There has recently been a concerted effort to commence a transition to fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) in Europe. A coalition of companies released an influential McKinsey-coordinated report in 2010, which concluded that FCVs are ready for commercial deployment. Public-private H2Mobility programmes have subsequently been established across Europe to develop business cases for the introduction of FCVs. In this paper, we examine the conclusions of these studies from an energy systems perspective, using the UK as a case study. Other UK energy system studies have identified only a minor role for FCVs, after 2030, but we reconcile these views by showing that the differences are primarily driven by different data assumptions rather than methodological differences. Some energy system models do not start a transition to FCVs until around 2040 as they do not account for the time normally taken for the diffusion of new powertrains. We show that applying dynamic growth constraints to the UK MARKAL energy system model more realistically represents insights from innovation theory. We conclude that the optimum deployment of FCVs, from an energy systems perspective, is broadly in line with the roadmap developed by UK H 2Mobility and that a transition needs to commence soon if FCVs are to become widespread by 2050. {\textcopyright} 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this paper, we develop the principle of model archaeology as a formal method to quantitatively examine the balance and evolution of energy system models, through the ex post analysis of both model inputs and outputs using a series of metrics. These metrics help us to understand how models are developed and used and are a powerful tool for effectively targeting future model improvements. The usefulness of model archaeology is demonstrated in a case study examining the UK MARKAL model. We show how model development has been influenced by the interests of the UK government and the research projects funding model development. Despite these influences, there is clear evidence of a strategy to balance model complexity and accuracy when changes are made. We identify some important long-term trends including higher technology capital costs in subsequent model versions. Finally, we discuss how model archaeology can improve the transparency of research model studies.},

In this paper, we review how different energy system models have represented both vehicles and fuel infrastructure in the past and we provide guidelines for their representation in the future. In particular, we identify three key modelling decisions: the degree of car market segmentation, the imposition of market share constraints and the use of lumpy investments to represent infrastructure. We examine each of these decisions in a case study using the UK MARKAL model. While disaggregating the car market principally affects only the transition rate to the optimum mix of technologies, market share constraints can greatly change the optimum mix so should be chosen carefully. In contrast, modelling infrastructure using lumpy investments has little impact on the model results. We identify the development of new methodologies to represent the impact of behavioural change on transport demand as a key challenge for improving energy system models in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {The UK has an extensive natural gas pipeline network supplying 84% of homes. Previous studies of decarbonisation pathways using the UK MARKAL energy system model have concluded that the low-pressure gas networks should be mostly abandoned by 2050, yet most of the iron pipes near buildings are currently being replaced early for safety reasons. Our study suggests that this programme will not lock-in the use of gas in the long-term. We examine potential future uses of the gas network in the UK energy system using an improved version of UK MARKAL that introduces a number of decarbonisation options for the gas network including bio-methane, hydrogen injection to the natural gas and conversion of the network to deliver hydrogen. We conclude that hydrogen conversion is the only gas decarbonisation option that might enable the gas networks to continue supplying energy to most buildings in the long-term, from a cost-optimal perspective. There is an opportunity for the government to adopt a long-term strategy for the gas distribution networks that either curtails the iron mains replacement programme or alters it to prepare the network for hydrogen conversion; both options could substantially reduce the long-term cost of supplying heat to UK buildings. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Currently, electricity production in Reunion Island is mainly based on imported fuels while it is blessed with high levels of renewable energy potentials. The issue addressed in this paper is the technical and economical feasibility of this ambitious target. The approach relies on a prospective study conducted by the TIMES-Reunion model which provides future production mixes according to different scenarios. It is combined with a quantitative assessment of reliability of power supply with two reliability indicators, regarding that intermittent sources may highly develop and consequently worsen reliability. This study enables us to draw three main conclusions: (i) electricity autonomy can be achieved thanks to high levels of biomass production and of intermittent sources; (ii) however, since fuel oil's power plants appear as back-up units, the reliability of power supply will be lowered. This is illustrated by the decrease of the reliability indicators over the time horizon; (iii) however, provided that appropriate rules on the instantaneous production are enforced, a generation mix that both complies with the electricity autonomy target and with a satisfying reliability of power supply is possible.},

It is usually ensured by controlling voltage and frequency deviations and involves events occurring from a few milliseconds to a few hours. However, reliability requirements are largely ignored when dealing with long-term issues. To reconcile such contrasting timescales, it seems logical to rely on energy considerations based on thermodynamics. Two reliability indicators, assessing the magnetic and kinetic energy reserves of a power system, are derived from this approach. They enable to quantify the reliability of a given production mix and make it possible to choose between increasing shares of intermittent sources and maintaining an expected level of reliability. Since the indicators tackle reliability issues without focusing on a specific timescale, they are effective for both discussing the long-term evolution of reliability and improving the real-time management of a power system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To derive cost-effective measures for CO2 mitigation, the authors of this paper develop a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for China's transport sector. Using the TIMES model, MAC curves are derived which identify the linkages among all transport modes, considering, among other uncertainties, the impacts of a carbon peaking policy and driver preferences for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The results underline that the intercity passenger transport sector has a cost advantage, with a huge potential for emissions reduction (accounting for almost 38.8% of all CO2 emissions mitigation). The freight sector is another potentially significant contributor to CO2 reduction, underlining its vital role for emission mitigation in the longer run. The carbon peak policy, while making alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) more efficient, is found to increase the overall cost of emissions reduction. A higher ratio of electricity to fossil fuel use by PHEVs drivers would help the transport sector to reduce CO2 much faster. The sensitivity analysis of these and other factors is also estimated in this paper. The final MAC curves provide valuable insights for future low-carbon energy development strategies of China's transport sector.},

Steel, aluminium and cement are the key manufacturing industries in India which provide inputs to various other sectors such as construction, transportation, power transmission, etc. As a result, their demand is consistently rising. These industries are heavily energy-intensive and use raw materials such as iron ore, coal, electricity, steam, and fuel oil, whose supply can act as severe production constraints over a period of time and can hinder sustainable development. Hence it becomes imperative for these industries to continuously innovate more energy efficient techniques. This paper makes a foray into the energy demand for these industries and explores the potential of any future reduction in their energy consumption. The paper offers a projection scenario for 2001-2031 (based on the MARKAL Modeling exercise for India) for possible catching up in reduction in energy consumptions in these sectors under alternative situations. The analysis suggests the existence of some plausible energy efficiency enhancing techniques in these industries. Exploring these options will definitely ensure cost effectiveness and competitiveness of these three key sectors in the global market. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The post-2012 climate policy framework needs a global commitment to deep greenhouse gas emission cuts. This paper analyzes reaching ambitious emission targets up to 2050, either - 10 % or - 50 % from 1990 levels, and how the economic burden from mitigation efforts could be equitably shared between countries. The scenarios indicate a large low-cost mitigation potential in electricity and industry, while reaching low emission levels in international transportation and agricultural emissions might prove difficult. The two effort sharing approaches, Triptych and Multistage, were compared in terms of equitability and coherence. Both approaches produced an equitable cost distribution between countries, with least developed countries having negative or low costs and more developed countries having higher costs. There is, however, no definitive solution on how the costs should be balanced equitably between countries. Triptych seems to be yet more coherent than other approaches, as it can better accommodate national circumstances. Last, challenges and possible hindrances to effective mitigation and equitable effort sharing are presented. The findings underline the significance of assumptions behind effort sharing on mitigation potentials and current emissions, the challenge of sharing the effort with uncertain future allowance prices and how inefficient markets might undermine the efficiency of a cap-and-trade system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To reinforce the long-term commitment to climate change mitigation, the post-2012 climate policy framework is aimed to be completed by 2009. The new agreement needs to include a wider participation of parties, and therefore needs to address the effort sharing of countries. The mitigation capabilities and the responsibilities of countries do however vary significantly. This can, in principle, be overcome with a cap-and-trade system, with which the question of equity is addressed trough the allocation of emission allowances. A number of effort sharing schemes have been proposed. Effort sharing however suffers from a fundamental trade-off between detail and transparency on how the emission allocations are calculated. This study addresses this problem by comparing and combining the results from a transparent but simplified effort sharing model EVOC, and a detailed and - due to its complexity - seemingly non-transparent ETSAP-TIAM energy system model. The aim of the study is to evaluate the goodness of the initial effort sharing, particularly in terms of mitigation costs experienced by different regions in the scenarios. Based on the long-term energy-climate scenarios crafted with the TIAM model, we assess the resulting consequences in emission profiles and the energy system, concentrating especially on regional mitigation costs and emission trading. Two cases of market failures in emission trading are also considered. Finally we compare the mitigation potentials between the two models and estimate the effect of EVOC recalibration on the national emission allowances. The results of the study underline particularly the importance of detailed and reliable assumptions for the mitigation potentials of different countries in the effort sharing process.

abstract = {This article analyses the implications of long-term low-carbon scenarios for the UK, and against these it assesses both the current status and the required scope of the UK energy policy. The scenarios are generated using the well-established MARKAL (acronym for MARKet ALlocation) UK energy systems model, which has already been extensively used for UK policy analysis and support. The scenarios incorporate different levels of ambition for carbon reduction, ranging from 40% to 90% cuts from 1990's level by the year 2050, to shed insights into the options for achieving the UK's current legally binding target of an 80% cut by the same date. The scenarios achieve their carbon reductions through very different combinations of demand reduction (implying behaviour change) and implementation of low-carbon and energy efficiency technologies on both the supply and demand sides. In all cases, however, the costs of achieving the reductions are relatively modest. The ensuing policy analysis suggests that while the cuts are feasible both technically and economically and while a number of new policies have been introduced in order to achieve them, it is not yet clear whether these policies will deliver the required combination of both short- and long-term technology deployment, and behaviour change for the UK Government's targets to be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2011 Earthscan.},

Readers should be aware that the cut-off date for information included was December 2012 and the report may not, therefore, reflect the situation at the time of reading. Phase 1 of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) facilitated the development of a state-of-the-art MARKAL model of the UK energy system. MARKAL is a well established linear optimisation, energy system model, developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) of the International Energy Agency (IEA) in the 1970s, and was until very recently used by it for its annual Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) reports. It is also used by many other research teams round the world, and has been regularly updated and improved over the years through the ETSAP Implementing Agreement. Towards the end of UKERC's Phase 1, in 2007-8, UK MARKAL was used for a major modelling exercise of different projections of the UK energy system to 2050, the results of which were published in Skea at al 2011. In the ensuing years, UK MARKAL was again used for major 2050-focused modelling projects: for the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) in 2010 (CCC 2010), for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in 2011 (HMG 2011), and again for UKERC to update the Energy 2050 scenarios in 2012.

The framework incorporates the interactions between agricultural and energy markets at the macro-level, and an assessment of production practices and environmental impacts at the micro (field)-level. For macro-level analysis, we use two existing modeling frameworks: the CARD U.S. agricultural markets model and the MARKAL energy systems model. The integrated modeling of agricultural and energy markets will be useful in analyzing a range of scenarios regarding the role of biomass feedstocks from the agricultural sector in an expanding market for biomass-based fuels and energy. Moreover, by linking the macro-level analysis to the micro-scale (field-level) analysis, we can represent shifts in farming practices, average productivity, and costs of production, as well as the environmental consequences of farmers' decisions resulting from the expansion of biomass feedstock production. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results of the analysis show that a hydrogen FCV would not be cost competitive until 2050 without a more severe carbon tax than the government's planned 2400 JPY/t-C carbon tax. However, as the carbon tax rate increases, instead of conventional vehicles including the gasoline hybrid electric vehicle, hydrogen FCVs gain market penetration earlier and more. By assuming a more severe carbon tax rate, such as 10 000 JPY/t-C, the market share of hydrogen FCVs approaches the governmental goal. This suggests that cheaper vehicle cost and hydrogen cost than those targeted in the roadmap should be attained or subsidies to hydrogen FCV and hydrogen refueling station will be necessary for achieving the goal of earlier market penetration. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

The first uses energy models to investigate the role of hydrogen in an energy and power market perspective, without considering hydrogen export. The second, uses an economic equilibrium model to examine the potential role of hydrogen export in value creation. The third analysis is a socio-technical case study on the drivers and barriers for hydrogen production in Norway. Main conclusions are that access to renewable power and hydrogen are prerequisites for decarbonization of transport and industrial sectors in Norway, and that hydrogen is a key to maintain a high level of economic activity. Structural changes in the economy, impacts of new technologies, and key enablers and barriers in this transition are discussed.},

Energy system modelling can provide crucial insights into the inherent uncertainty in such strategies, which needs to be understood when designing appropriate policy measures. This study contributes to the growing research area of uncertainty analysis in energy system models. We combine consistent and realistic narratives on several technology dimensions with a global sensitivity analysis in a national, bottom-up, optimizing energy system model. This produces structured insights into the impact of low-carbon technology and resource availability on the long-term development of the UK energy system under ambitious decarbonisation pathways. We explore a variety of result metrics to present policy-relevant results in a useful and concise manner. The results provide valuable information on the variability of fuel and technology use across the uncertainty space (e.g. a strong variation in natural gas demand). We demonstrate the complementarities and substitutability of technologies (e.g. the dependency of hydrogen technologies on the availability of CCS). We highlight critical low-carbon options and hedging strategies (e.g. the early decarbonisation of the electricity sector or the stronger use of renewable sources as a hedging against failure in other technologies) and demonstrate timing and path dependencies (e.g. the importance of early decarbonisation action in the presence of multiple technology uncertainty). The results also show how the availability of a given technology can have wider impacts elsewhere in the energy system, thus complicating the management of a long-term energy transition.},

Its methodological novelty is the incorporation of a process-oriented modelling approach based on a comprehensive technology database for the industry sector in a national energy system model for the UK (UKTM), allowing quantification of the role of both decarbonisation of upstream energy vectors and of mitigation options in the industrial sub-categories. This enhanced model is then applied in a comparative policy scenario analysis that explores various target dimensions on emission mitigation, renewable energy and energy efficiency at both a national and European level. The results show that ambitious emission cuts in the industry sector of up to 77% until 2050 compared to 2010 can be achieved. Moreover, with a reduction in industrial energy demand of up to 31% between 2010 and 2050, the sector is essential for achieving the overall efficiency commitments. The industry sector also makes a moderate contribution to the expansion of renewable energies mostly through the use of biomass for low-temperature heating services. However, additional sub-targets on renewable sources and energy efficiency need to be assessed critically, as they can significantly distort the cost-efficiency of the long-term mitigation pathway.},

In particular, the practicability of using "White Certificates" (energy efficiency) along the same lines as "Green Certificates" (renewable energy) was explored. Several of the policies and measures were simulated using technical-economic models of the MARKAL family. The results show that by 2020 it is possible to increase energy efficiency by 15% at no cost without taking externalities into account. If externalities are considered, an increase of 30-35% with respect to the business-as-usual scenario is justified. The wealth of information obtained through the models and analysis provides a set of recommendations for policy-makers, including: (1) the need for closer co-ordination between energy policies and environmental and climate policies; (2) the opportunity to establish more ambitious targets for energy efficiency; (3) the scope for increased EU co-ordination; (4) the extension of White Certificates to the medium and low energy-intensive industries; (5) the need to support White Certificates with accompanying actions, such as running information campaigns, promoting energy service companies, and providing dedicated credit lines; (6) the need to develop similar instruments for transport and (7) the continuing need for energy research and development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper delivers three main outcomes. First, we identify key criteria for analyzing current ESMs and we describe seven current and future low-carbon energy system modeling challenges: the increasing need for flexibility, further electrification, emergence of new technologies, technological learning and efficiency improvements, decentralization, macroeconomic interactions, and the role of social behavior in the energy system transition. These criteria are then translated into required modeling capabilities such as the need for hourly temporal resolution, sectoral coupling technologies (e.g., P2X), technological learning, flexibility technologies, stakeholder behavior, cross border trade, and linking with macroeconomic models. Second, a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps while clarifying high modeling capabilities of MARKAL, TIMES, REMix, PRIMES, and METIS. Third, to bridge major energy modeling gaps, two conceptual modeling suites are suggested, based on both optimization and simulation methodologies, in which the integrated ESM is hard-linked with a regional model and an energy market model and soft-linked with a macroeconomic model.},

abstract = {Against the background of the ambitious German targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, this paper investigates the economic potential for thermal load management with virtual power plants consisting of micro-cogeneration plants, heat pumps and thermal storage within the residential sector. An optimising energy system model of the electricity and residential heat supply in Germany is developed in the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL EFOM System) modelling framework and used to determine capacity developments and dispatch of electricity and residential heat generation technologies until 2050. The analysed scenarios differ with respect to the rate of technological development of heat and power devices, fuel and CO2 prices as well as renewable electricity expansion. Results show that high fuel prices and a high renewable electricity expansion favour heat pumps and insulation measures over micro-cogeneration, whereas lower fuel prices and lower renewable electricity expansion relatively favour the expansion of micro-cogeneration. In the former case heat pump capacities increase to around 67GWel, whereas in the latter case the total capacity of micro-cogeneration reaches 8GWel. With the aid of thermal storage, this provides considerable flexibility for electrical load shifting through heat pumps and electricity generation from micro-cogeneration in residential applications, needed for the integration of fluctuating renewable electricity technologies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

abstract = {It is of important practical significance to reduce NOx emission and CO2 emission in China's cement industry. This paper firstly identifies key factors that influence China's future cement demand, and then uses the Gompertz model to project China's future cement demand and production. Furthermore, the multi-pollutant abatement planning model (MAP) was developed based on the TIMES model to analyze the co-benefits of CO2 and NOx control in China's cement industry. During modeling analysis, three scenarios such as basic as usual scenario (BAU), moderately low carbon scenario (MLC), and radically low carbon scenario (RLC), were built according to different policy constraints and emission control goals. Moreover, the benefits of co-controlling NOx and CO2 emission in China's cement industry have been estimated. Finally, this paper proposes a cost-efficient, green, and low carbon development roadmap for the Chinese cement sector, and puts forwards countermeasures as follows: first, different ministries should enhance communication and coordination about how to promote the co-control of NOx and CO2 in cement industry. Second, co-control technology list should be issued timely for cement industry, and the R&D investment on new technologies and demonstration projects should be increased. Third, the phase-out of old cement capacity needs to be continued at policy level. Fourth, it is important to scientifically evaluate the relevant environmental impact and adverse motivation of ammonia production by NOx removal requirement in cement industry.},

This paper focuses on how cities formulate economic instruments and adopt carbon pricing experiments to support their climate objectives. Extensive literature is available on science-policy-making interface Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) and on the two mainstream approaches of carbon cost formulation—Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC). Although, the literature on how governments develop climate policy instruments, particularly towards a local carbon cost, is recent. We start by reviewing these essential concepts and tools for carbon cost formulation. We then critically review a set of local carbon pricing experiments, totaling fourteen international cities, and confirm a great demand for scientifically robust, verifiable, and transferable carbon cost methodologies at the local level. We thus propose an approach to assess the short-term technology cost of CO2 emission reduction in the mobility sector in Matosinhos municipality, Portugal. Our approach shows that a carbon cost methodology at the local level with robust, verifiable, and transferable results is possible. We advocate for a methodological advance to estimate versatile CO2 prices suitable for local conditions.},

How the transport sector evolve during the coming decades will have significant impact on the possibilities to meet tough climate and environmental targets.

Energy system optimisation models, like the TIMES modelling framework, are useful tools in identifying energy pathways to reach ambitious energy savings and emission mitigation targets. Based on the identification of urban transport-energy system characteristics, the needs of local governments, and insights from traditional transport models, we propose a partly new representation of the transport sector within a TIMES-City modelling framework, adapting it to the urban transport-energy setting to improve model realism and power of insight.

abstract = {The objective of this study is to improve evaluations of the future use of biomass sources in Sweden and France by representing the high spatial variations of the supply and cost of biomass sources in energy system models. The proposed methodology considers a high spatial disaggregation of biomass supply sources, as well as detailed biomass cost-supply curves, and is thereby able to account for spatial differences in heterogeneous land qualities, management strategies, and possible adaptation rates. Integrating the methodology into national or regional energy system models will enhance cost-effective evaluations of biomass sources as well as the development of the bioenergy sector. A TIMES energy system model was used to evaluate bioenergy production potential for France and Sweden based on domestic biomass sources and under the assumption that bioenergy production should not be at the expense of domestic food and forestry supply. Results show that by 2050, the biomass sources considered could provide as much as 250PJ of bioenergy in Sweden, and 1470PJ of bioenergy in France. Results further showed that 1st generation biofuels are likely to continue to play a substantial role in the biofuel mix. While 2nd generation biofuel production in Sweden is likely to be low, larger amounts of 2nd generation biofuels could be produced in France. However, the amount and type of 2nd generation biofuel produced in France was found to be highly dependent on the bioenergy demand level. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The development of scenarios to explore energy and low carbon futures has been widely applied. Although some studies combine qualitative scenarios with quantitative outcomes from modeling exercises, the two approaches have been extensively and separately used. Many energy scenarios are sustained only by the results of the models, which allow great technological details but neglect the interaction with social and economic factors. Using Portugal as a case study, this paper presents a framework to link socio-economic storylines, sustained by national stakeholders' workshops, with the development of quantitative energy scenarios through 2050, generated by the technology-based TIMES_PT model. The storylines highlight different visions of the country's development, including the energy system. A comparison between the energy profile from the storylines and the energy modeling outcomes was performed to assess the extent of their differences. This analysis revealed generally similar visions, with the exception of the importance of some technologies, which may affect future energy planning. We conclude that a combined method that links socio-economic storylines and energy modeling increases the robustness of energy scenario development because providing a coherent context for modeling assumptions allows better reasoning, which is most valued for the decision-making process.},

abstract = {Carbon capture, utilization and storage scenarios have been developed for the Lusitanian Basin (Portuguese region) under the STRATEGY CCUS project, considering Portugal's carbon neutrality goal up to 2050. Supported by the national energy policy vision, the scenarios assume the use of captured biogenic CO2 emissions to generate synthetic methane as well as the geological storage of fossil CO2. Although carbon capture, utilization and storage tackles CO2 emissions, while maintaining fuel combustion and industrial processes, the deployment of the technology may lead to side effects on the overall energy system, such as on renewable power generation necessary to produce synthetic fuels. This study analyses the spillover effects (i.e., the impacts) of carbon capture, utilization and storage in the Lusitanian Basin in the Portuguese energy system, namely in the national power capacity and final energy consumption. The analysis is supported by the linear optimization energy system model TIMES_PT. Results show that by 2050, the generation of synthetic methane by hydrogen from electrolysis and CO2 (e-gas) demands a large amount of green hydrogen, 29% more than compared with a cost-effective decarbonization scenario. Consequently, a higher installed power capacity of solar and wind (above 6 GW by 2050) will be required. Contrary to what would be expected, the mandatory generation of e-gas does not lead to a reduction in electricity consumption in final users, as the synthetic fuel substitutes instead biomass/biogas and the direct use of hydrogen.},

This paper describes the development of an integrated technological, economic modeling platform (HYBTEP), built through the soft-link between the bottom-up TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM system) and the CGE GEM-E3 models. HYBTEP combines cost minimizing energy technology choices with macroeconomic responses, which is essential for energy-climate policy assessment. HYBTEP advances on other hybrid tools by assuming 'full-form' models, integrating detailed and extensive technology data with disaggregated economic structure, and 'full-link', i.e., covering all economic sectors. Using Portugal as a case study, we examine three scenarios: (i) the current energy-climate policy, (ii) a CO2 tax, and (iii) renewable energy subsidy, with the objective of assessing the advantages of HYBTEP vis-{\`{a}}-vis bottom-up approach. Results show that the economic framework in HYBTEP partially offsets the increase or decrease in energy costs from the policy scenarios, while TIMES is very sensitive to energy services-price elasticities, setting a wide range of results. HYBTEP allows the computation of the economic impacts of policies in a technological detailed environment. The hybrid platform increases transparency of policy analysis by making explicit the mechanisms through which energy demand evolves, resulting in high confidence for decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The deep decarbonisation of the power sector coupled with electrification of end-use sectors will be crucial towards a carbon neutral economy, as required to achieve the Paris Agreement's goal. Several studies have highlighted the relevance of electrification under deep decarbonisation. However, previous work does not explore what would be the major shifts towards electrification, i.e., in what economic activities it will likely occur and when up to 2050 considering gradually stricter GHG emissions constraints. This is of upmost relevance since relatively small variations in emission caps may trigger substantial modifications in specific components of the energy system, namely the shift for the electrification of a particular energy end-use, with impacts on the power sector's portfolio. In this paper, we analyse the extension of the electrification of the energy system as a cost-effective strategy for deep decarbonisation. We set a large number of increasingly stringent mitigation caps to assess: (i) the degree of electrification of different energy end-uses across all economic activities, (ii) the impact in power sector portfolio and costs and (iii) investment needs. The novelty of this paper relies on the anticipation of electrification of activities traditionally supplied by non-electricity energy carriers, by exploring when and how such transformation may occur in the future, and how much it would cost. We assess the case of Portugal till 2050 by using the TIMES_PT model to generate 50 increasingly stricter decarbonisation scenarios. In the long term, incremental changes (+1%) in more aggressive decarbonisation targets (beyond −70% reduction) induce substantial increase in the share of electrification growth rates. Electric private vehicles, electricity-based steam and heat production in ceramic industrial sector and heat pumps in buildings are the most cost-effective electric technologies. We found that a decarbonisation up to near −80% of 1990′s levels of the Portuguese energy system does not have a significant impact on the power sector unit costs, and does not surpass historic values for some years. However, it should be noted that incremental changes (+1%) in more aggressive decarbonisation targets may increase sharply electricity costs in 2050 (+9%). Thus, focusing in only few scenarios may narrow the role of electrification (or other mitigation options) and its associated costs for deep decarbonisation. This paper allows researchers, planners and decision makers to enhance awareness regarding the relevance and cost-effectiveness of electrification under decarbonisation, namely its feasibility and affordability, providing fruitful insights.},

abstract = {Bottom-up and top-down models are used to support climate policies, to identify the options required to meet GHG abatement targets and to evaluate their economic impact. Some studies have shown that the GHG mitigation options provided by economic top-down and technological bottom-up models tend to vary. One reason for this is that these models tend to use different baseline scenarios. The bottom-up TIMES_PT and the top-down computable general equilibrium GEM-E3_PT models are examined using a common baseline scenario to calibrate them, and the extend of their different mitigation options and its relevant to domestic policy making are assessed. Three low-carbon scenarios for Portugal until 2050 are generated, each with different GHG reduction targets. Both models suggest close mitigation options and locate the largest mitigation potential to energy supply. However, the models suggest different mitigation options for the end-use sectors: GEM-E3_PT focuses more on energy efficiency, while TIMES_PT relies on decrease carbon intensity due to a shift to electricity. Although a common baseline scenario cannot be ignored, the models' inherent characteristics are the main factor for the different outcomes, thereby highlighting different mitigation options. Policy relevance The relevance of modelling tools used to support the design of domestic climate policies is assessed by evaluating the mitigation options suggested by a bottom-up and a top-down model. The different outcomes of each model are significant for climate policy design since each suggest different mitigation options like end-use energy efficiency and the promotion of low-carbon technologies. Policy makers should carefully select the modelling tool used to support their policies. The specific modelling structures of each model make them more appropriate to address certain policy questions than others. Using both modelling approaches for policy support can therefore bring added value and result in more robust climate policy design. Although the results are specific for Portugal, the insights provided by the analysis of both models can be extended to, and used in the climate policy decisions of, other countries. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Furthermore, total system costs are compared to a reference scenario. Existing analysis with TIAM shows different ways of reaching the 2 °C target (increase in global mean temperature) and also how uncertainty on different factors influences the optimal solution. The main conclusion from existing analysis with TIAM is that the 2 °C target is possible to reach, but it will be expensive. Another very important point is that if uncertainty on the value of the climate sensitivity (Cs) is taken into account then the optimal strategy calls for early action compared to a full foresight optimisation using the most probable value of Cs. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Provided that technologies alone could not solve the problem, we have integrated the sociological dimension, represented by the potentially powerful resource for energy conservation that exists in the ability of consumers to change their behaviour. This study aims at proposing a new MARKAL framework that would take into account consumers' technological improvements and behavioural changes minimizing carbon dioxide emissions and encouraging rational use of energy. As opposed to the traditional MARKAL framework based on technical and economic considerations, the SOMARKAL model integrates technological, economic and behavioural contributions to the environment. Essentially, the conceptual aspects of the SOMARKAL will be presented. Based on this new MARKAL formulation, we will simulate the possible contribution of awareness campaigns in triggering energy consumption behavioural changes and possibilities of technology switch, in the residential area of the city of Nyon (Switzerland), for the period 2005-2025, using ANSWER, the IEA's platform. The main focus is on lighting technologies. Three fictitious scenarios were produced, referring to three possible penetration rates of low consumption lighting technologies.},

For this, our model has been extended by disaggregating the agricultural demand sector into individual agri-food demands to allow for a more in-depth analysis. Besides a business-as-usual (baseline) scenario, we have constructed four different agri-food scenarios to assess the viability of reducing Canadian meat and dairy consumption in order to diminish Canada's agricultural sector energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our policy scenarios progressively restrict the consumption of different meat and dairy agricultural products until the year 2030. Our results suggest that the implementation of a meat and dairy consumption reduction policy would lead to a 10 to 40 % reduction in agricultural GHG emissions, depending on the severity of the scenario. This translates to a 1 to 3 % decrease in total Canadian GHG emissions by the year 2030. Besides these environmental benefits, health benefits associated with a reduction in meat and dairy consumption (as inferred from other studies) are presented as an additional source of motivation for implementing such a policy in Canada.},

Six scenarios were developed – reference case, NDC, global 2 °C and three scenarios where CO2 emissions of all model regions converged in 2050 based on criteria of GDP/capita, emissions intensity of GDP and per capita emissions. The analysis shows that emission rights allocation schemes influence the total energy system development costs, long-term electricity generation requirements, and share of renewables especially solar PV generation to meet the 2 °C target. The model runs also show that solar-PV is the single most important generation technology for decarbonisation of India's power sector. Limiting the share of solar-PV generation can lead to 20% reduction in total electricity generation and increase system costs substantially for 2050. Further, the results also indicate that India may have 200–215 GW of stranded coal generation assets in 2050 in the low carbon scenarios. Our analysis suggest that India is one of those countries which are at the development stage and also highly risked with the lock-in in carbon emitting infrastructure especially coal-based generations unless action taken in the near-term.},

abstract = {This paper contributes to the climate policy discussion by focusing on the challenges and opportunities of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 in Italy. To support Italian energy planning, we developed energy roadmaps towards national climate neutrality, consistent with the Paris Agreement objectives and the IPCC goal of limiting the increase in global surface temperature to 1.5◦ C. Starting from the Italian framework, these scenarios identify the correlations among the main pillars for the change of the energy paradigm towards net emissions by 2050. The energy scenarios were developed using TIMES-RSE, a partial equilibrium and technology-rich optimization model of the entire Italian energy system. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis was developed with the sMTISIM, a long-term simulator of power system and electricity markets. The results show that, to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the Italian energy system will have to experience profound transformations on multiple and strongly related dimensions. A predominantly renewable-based energy mix (at least 80–90% by 2050) is essential to decarbonize most of the final energy consumption. However, the strong increase of non-programmable renewable sources requires particular attention to new flexibility resources needed for the power system, such as Power-to-X. The green fuels produced from renewables via Power-to-X will be a vital energy source for those sectors where electrification faces technical and economic barriers. The paper's findings also confirm that the European “energy efficiency first” principle represents the very first step on the road to climate neutrality.},

abstract = {Fast-emerging (yet still relatively less developed) economies such as India are understandably cautious about committing to emissions reduction targets that could be economically costly. The tensions between continuing short-term economic growth whilst investing in low-carbon technologies for long-term decarbonisation could be eased if there were significant financial and non-climate potential benefits of decarbonisation for these economies. This study explores some of the potential benefits for India, by analysing its long-term mitigation options in the context of global action towards a 2°C target, using an energy systems model (The University College London TIMES Integrated Assessment Model, or TIAM-UCL) which represents India explicitly, as one of 16 global regions. The study finds that India could significantly over-achieve against a 2050 low-carbon target based on equal per capita emissions by 2050, at mitigation costs below the global carbon price, implying that it could earn significant revenues through selling international carbon credits, thereby offsetting some of the costs of decarbonisation. In addition, India would see much lower levels of fossil fuel consumption in a low-carbon scenario, thereby alleviating potential economic difficulties in securing access to adequate supplies of these fuels.},

This work has been carried out to ease the lack of National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) assessments at country level. The Spanish case has been used as illustrative of the European Union. The evolution of NOx and SO2 emissions has been analysed in depth using the TIMES-Spain energy optimisation model. The work has been structured into three parts. First, the implementation of the NECD and the consequences both on the evolution of NOx and SO2 emissions, and the electricity production mix; second, taxation on these pollutants has been modelled and discussed; and finally, the proposed "2013 EU Clean Air Package" ceilings to update NECD have been assessed. Results showed that meeting NECD targets would involve a high contribution of renewable sources to the electricity system, mainly wind and solar. In addition, NOx and SO2 taxation has been assessed. Results showed that taxes on pollutants led to lower emissions than using NECD. Hence, current ceilings are not strict enough to internalise all the environmental damages associated to those pollutants. In consequence, the suitability of the NECD has been discussed by means of the new ceilings included in the EU Clean Air Policy Package. Results showed that proposed reductions are insufficient to compensate the environmental damages especially in the short term.},

abstract = {During the past decade, the Spanish cement production industry has experienced constant technological updates. Nevertheless, meeting current and future environmental policy goals requires extra efforts. The Spanish case is significant because cement production went down dramatically due to the last economic crisis. This brought an important, but temporary, reduction of CO2 emissions. Therefore, there is an interesting opportunity for cement producers and policymakers to adjust the long-term targets. This work discusses the evolution of the cement industry in Spain from a realistic point of view using recent cement demand projections and the TIMES-Spain energy optimisation model. Several environmental-friendly options were implemented in TIMES-Spain following a literature review. These measures, aimed at contributing to the decrease of emissions to meet the established policy goals, include energy efficiency improvements, substitution scenarios (both for fuel and materials) and CO2 capture (post-combustion and oxyfuel). From a policy approach, the deployment of the EU ETS Directive entails that CO2 emissions from cement production will decrease by 8 Mt per year from 2030 with respect to the case without Directive. In a more technology-specific analysis, a remarkable decrease of 2-2.4 Mt CO2 was obtained in the material substitution scenario beyond 2030. Additionally, taking into account current projections for cement demand, CO2 capture technology does not emerge as a feasible option. Only if cement demand grew back to the pre-crisis level by 2050 and the CO2 emission allowances remained fixed would the CO2 capture via post-combustion start to be a reasonable alternative.},

abstract = {The selection of the social discount rate and the consideration of hurdle rates in energy systems optimisation models affect the creation of sound and comprehensive scenarios useful for energy modellers. Due to the lack of studies about the use of different discounting options in energy optimisation models, the goal of this paper is to fill that gap by establishing the foundations for a debate among energy modellers, policy-makers and stakeholders in this regard. So firstly, we introduced the concept of discount rates both social and technology-specific including a thorough literature review concerning figures, scopes and approaches. Secondly, two models, ETSAP-TIAM and TIMES-Norway, were used to assess the behaviour of the energy systems at different regionalisation levels, Europe and Norway respectively. Thirdly, we analysed the evolution of the electricity production mixes and system costs for both models and considering several values for the discount rates. Finally, results showed that the energy system is strongly affected by changes in the social discount rate. The lower the social discount rate is, the higher the renewable contribution. The social discounting exerts influence on capital intensive investments so it is quite important to look at the energy carriers pathways (fossil-renewable transition). This is what happens in the case of ETSAP-TIAM for Europe. Reversely, in the case of TIMES-Norway, as the electricity system is almost 100% renewable, it is important to take into account the hurdle rates of the technologies to enrich the competition by including their particular risks and barriers. In summary, we recommend using a value not higher than 4-5% for the social discount rate for the European countries as well as to include an exhaustive portfolio of hurdle rates for all the technologies included in the energy optimisation model.},

abstract = {This paper presents a set of prospective LCA studies of electricity production technologies of the Spanish mix from 2014 to 2050. The projection of the power system has been done by using the TIMES-Spain energy model, in which two prospective scenarios have been implemented, a Business as Usual (BaU) and other with a target of 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 with respect to 2005 levels. Accordingly, projections of ten LCA impact categories have been obtained. Concerning the evolution of the electricity mix, the coal power plants retirement by 2020 has been observed in both scenarios. The main differences befall on the natural gas contribution, higher in the BaU scenario than in 80% scenario and connected to the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants usage. In addition, LCA categories selected show overall reductions in the long term reaching from 21% in Ozone Depletion to 85% in Acidification in the BaU scenario, and from 56% in Ecosystems to 87% in Acidification in the 80% scenario. However, Abiotic Depletion potential grows up to 5-times by 2050 due to the metal requirements of the solar photovoltaic technologies, significantly present in the mix. Likewise, the analysis of the endpoint categories (Human Health and Ecosystems) concludes that their evolution is much affected by the presence of the natural gas CHPs and, furthermore, existing fossil options are the main cause of damage by far. Hence a fossil-renewable transition is needed in terms of sustainability. In summary, it is recommended to use energy systems modelling frameworks to develop comprehensive prospective LCA studies.},

abstract = {Various modeling studies analyzing global 2 °C climate stabilization scenarios have projected penetration of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies in India alongside a sizable penetration of renewable energy technologies. The assessments of geological storage potential over India have shown wide variation across regions. This paper examines the locations of large point sources of CO2 emissions in India and matches it with carbon storage locations to minimize the cost of CCS evolving grid. The concept of weighted Euclidean distance and Integrated Environmental Control Model are used to propose suitable pipeline networks for emissions-intensive clusters to optimize the cost of CO2 avoidance. The computational method estimates proximate storage location for each CO2 emitting source taking into account the total storage potential at each location. CCS requirement in India would vary depending on the global climate stabilization target. We examine two targets for India that correspond to 2 °C and well below 2 °C global mitigation regimes. According to our estimates, India could mitigate around 780 Mt CO2 per year below 60 $/t-CO2 (2005 prices) over 30 years, and another 250 Mt CO2 per year for up to 75 $/t-CO2 prices through CCS under these scenarios respectively.},

In this respect a number of initiatives and programmes (e.g. Covenant of Mayors, Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, CONCERTO, CIVITAS, etc.) have been set up in order to engage European cities in the effort towards a low carbon future and an improved quality of life through sustainable economic development. These initiatives have been generally successful and have resulted in the commitment of an increasing number of European cities towards sustainable development goals. At the same time, however, it has been revealed that there is a critical need for improved comprehensive city planning driven by an integrated and strategic approach, focused on cost benefit assessment towards sustainable energy use. This paper presents an innovative city planning approach developed within the EU FP7 project InSMART. It brings together four European municipalities - Evora (Portugal), Nottingham (UK), Trikala (Greece) and Cesena (Italy) -, academics, industries and technical consultants in order to establish a common methodology for enhancing sustainable planning for both the current and future city needs through an integrative and multidisciplinary approach. The methodology develops and employs a number of tools to assess the optimum mix of medium term measures (up to 2030) for a sustainable energy future, addressing the efficiency of energy flows across various city sectors with regards to economic, environmental and social criteria and paving the way towards actual implementation of priority actions. This paper presents the key concepts around this methodology and some selected results of the project (still ongoing). The results refer to the four city partners, all actively involved in developing a more sustainable energy system. Further on, the proposed approach may be replicable to other cities.},

Long-term energy system planning models overlook the impact of renewable intermittency on system operations due to the computational burden associated with large model size and long planning horizon. Hence, strategies such as soft-linking multiple models are developed, but they do not assure the convergence and optimality of such incoherent modeling framework. In this context, this paper utilizes unit commitment (UC) extension of TIMES modeling framework to integrate operational constraints directly in a long-term power system planning model. This strategy eliminates the complexity of handling multiple models. Results indicate that incorporation of UC constraints improve the performance of conventional generators in terms of increased capacity utilization, and help to assess flexibility requirements with high RESs. Energy storage provides the balancing and flexibility needs with stringent generator constraints. Sensitivity analysis shows that improved flexibility of thermal generators enables increased renewable penetrations.},

abstract = {Typically, energy system decarbonisation scenarios neglect the mitigation opportunities from reducing and restructuring energy service demands (ESDs), focusing instead on technology and fuel substitutions. Models tend to be designed to factor technologies explicitly while ESDs are exogenous. However, existing literature suggests that the scale and speed of decarbonisation required to limit global warming to 1.5∘ C by the end of the century requires a shift in energy demands to avoid the need for large-scale negative emission technologies. This can be brought about by major structural changes in drivers of demand such as transport modal shifting, substituting emission intensive materials like cement, and reducing building heat demand through behaviour change and efficiency. Ireland, the subject of this paper, has legislated one of the most ambitious decarbonisation targets in the world: the need to understand the role of demand shift is paramount. To fill this gap, the Irish Low Energy Demand (ILED) mitigation narrative is developed and applied to the TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM), an energy systems optimisation model. ILED represents a scenario where ESDs are decoupled from economic growth by shifting travel, increasing end-use efficiency, densifying urban settlement, focusing on low-energy intensive economic activities and changing social infrastructure. Compared to a scenario where ESDs follow ‘Business-as-usual' growth, ILED enables the achievement of steep decarbonisation targets with a less rapid energy system transformation, lower capital and marginal abatement costs, and with lower reliance on the deployment of novel technologies.},

The results were analyzed based on the final year CO2 emissions of the electricity system when compared to 1990 levels. The results show that when CO2 prices stay below 50€/tonne by 2050 there is no reduction in emitted CO2 emissions when compared to the levels of 1990. For CO2 prices reaching between 50 and 100€/tonne there is a clear reduction in CO2 with the increase in the price, from 7% with 50€/tonne to 79% with 100€/tonne. For prices above 100€/tonne the increased taxation has only a slight impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions, as even with a 300€/tonne price the CO2 reductions achieved are only of 87%. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Also, the predictions for CO2 emissions to the year of 2010 will be 45% above the defined limit. Applying TIMES model tool, this paper examines different scenarios regarding the price levels of CO2 taxes and trading under the Emissions Trading System in Europe and consider the perspectives of using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the scenario where the emissions licenses for CO2 credits are obtained for a price of 20 €/tonne of CO2 emitted, the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant will be the main thermal power plants in next three decades. After that period, the installed capacity of coal power plants will increase significantly from 2040 on and NGCC will almost vanish. In the scenarios where CCS was an option, the most significant conclusion is that above 50<€/tonne of CO2 emitted are the CCS technologies economically feasible, maintaining the predictions for electricity demand that show a slowly decrease after the year 2020. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Transport currently accounts for nearly half of global oil consumption and is the only field to be almost exclusively based upon a sole primary energy source. A possible evolution might be based on more oil-independent vehicles, on a higher use of energy efficient transport modes, on the integration of them through Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The answer to this partially global problem can be found both in transport and energy planning as well as in the adoption of new industrial and ICT technologies. Both energy strategy makers and transport planners need supporting tools for a better assessment of the impact of possible alternative policies and to set realistic targets for the transport sector. The present paper presents a conceptual link between two families of models - energy and transport - and provides some preliminary results of integrated modelling exercises for the Italian case, which show the importance of accurate ICT based data exchange between the models and the relevance of the comparison of present and future policy implementations.},

How far can countries ratchet up the mitigation ambition presented in the Nationally Determined Contributions? What is the magnitude of potential and necessary carbon dioxide removal, more particularly, biomass energy with carbon capture and storage? How can stranded assets be avoided? Is carbon neutrality achievable with technology innovation alone? These questions are at the core of the global, national and local energy systems modelling analyses in this book that explore the feasibility of roadmaps for a well below 2 °C future. The book is written by more than 20 teams of the IEA Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (IEA-ETSAP), a Technology Collaboration Programme supporting about 200 energy systems modelling teams from around 70 countries, which has operated for over 40 years. A key objective of IEA-ETSAP is to assist decision-makers in robustly developing, implementing and assessing the impact of energy and climate mitigation policies with the bottom-up techno-economic models of the MARKAL/TIMES family. This book constitutes a natural follow-up of the first book Informing Energy and Climate Policies Using Energy Systems Models, edited by IEA-ETSAP in 2015, prior to the Paris Agreement on climate change. The methodologies and case studies presented here illustrate how energy systems models have been and are being used to address complex energy and climate policy questions and provide critical insights into the feasibility of enhanced ambition. This responds directly to a requirement of the Paris Agreement and its Talanoa Dialogue to take stock of the collective efforts and determine how we can, all together, move the climate policy agenda forward and turn words into action.},

A clear and transparent harmonisation process promotes a consistent interpretation of the modelling outcomes divergences and, reducing the model variance, is instrumental to the use of integrated assessment models to support policy decision-making. Despite its crucial role for climate economic policies, the definition of a comprehensive harmonisation methodology for integrated assessment modelling remains an open challenge for the scientific community. This paper proposes a framework for a harmonisation methodology with the definition of indispensable steps and recommendations to overcome stumbling blocks in order to reduce the variance of the outcomes which depends on controllable modelling assumptions. The harmonisation approach of the PARIS REINFORCE project is presented here to layout such a framework. A decomposition analysis of the harmonisation process is shown through 6 integrated assessment models (GCAM, ICES-XPS, MUSE, E3ME, GEMINI-E3, and TIAM). Results prove the potentials of the proposed framework to reduce the model variance and present a powerful diagnostic tool to feedback on the quality of the harmonisation itself.},

abstract = {The international literature has paid much attention to so-called 'fringe benefits' of greenhouse gas (GHG) policies. The concept is that GHG emission reduction in developing countries will also reduce local air pollution. On the basis of this concept, it is argued that it is possible to achieve simultaneously a reduction of local air pollution and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In reality, however, there is a sequence to the policy agenda. First the apparent local air pollution problems are tackled then the more distant greenhouse gas problem is considered. This sequence has consequences for the optimal policy selection. Moreover, most studies that focus on fringe benefits of GHG policies neglect the existence of cost-effective dedicated abatement technology for local air pollutants. This paper analyses the optimal set of policies for reduction of SO2, NOx and CO2 in Shanghai for the period of 2000-2020. The analysis is based on a linear programming MARKAL model for the Shanghai energy system. The results show that the relevance of no-regret options is limited because Shanghai has improved its energy efficiency significantly in recent years. The model calculations suggest that this trend will persist if current policies are sustained. This energy efficiency improvement and the planned introduction of natural gas have important benefits from a GHG emission point of view. These benefits have received little attention as yet. Local air pollution reduction can result in additional GHG emission reduction up to 2010. After 2010, however, its CO2 emission co-benefits are limited. Dedicated abatement technology is the most cost-effective way to reduce local air pollution. An additional incentive of 100 Yuan/t CO2 emission reduction (12.5 Euro/t) results in an additional emission reduction of 11% (22 Mt CO2), and it results in a significantly different technology mix than stand-alone local air pollution policies. The total potential for GHG emission reduction amounts to 66 Mt in 2010 and to 49 Mt in 2020 compared to base case levels without policies. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper discusses in assessment of the optimal use of biomass in Western Europe for the long term (2010-2030) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment is based on a linear programming model for the Western European energy and materials system, called MARKAL MATTER 4.2. The goal of the study was the comparison of the cost-effectiveness and the interactions between bioenergy, biomaterials and afforestation strategies in comparison to other greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies. The results suggest that the use of biomass for energy and materials applications will increase by up to 200 Mt (compared to the case with no permit price) if greenhouse gas policies are introduced. The main increase occures in the production of transportation fuels and substitution of petrochemical feedstocks and electricity generation from waste and residues. Afforestation offers a cost-effective competing land-use strategy. The total contribution of biomass strategies is an emission reduction of up to 400 Mt CO2 equivalents (9% of 1990 emissions). {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ireland imports 88% of its energy requirements. Oil makes up 59% of total final energy consumption (TFC). Import dependency, low fuel diversity and volatile prices leave Ireland vulnerable in terms of energy security. This work models energy security scenarios for Ireland using long term macroeconomic forecasts to 2050, with oil production and price scenarios from the International Monetary Fund, within the Irish TIMES energy systems model. The analysis focuses on developing a least cost optimum energy system for Ireland under scenarios of constrained oil supply (0.8% annual import growth, and -2% annual import decline) and subsequent sustained long term price shocks to oil and gas imports. The results point to gas becoming the dominant fuel source for Ireland, at 54% total final energy consumption in 2020, supplanting oil from reference projections of 57% to 10.8% TFC. In 2012, the cost of net oil imports stood at €3.6 billion (2.26% GDP). The modelled high oil and gas price scenarios show an additional annual cost in comparison to a reference of between €2.9bn and €7.5bn by 2020 (1.9-4.9% of GDP) to choose to develop a least cost energy system. Investment and ramifications for energy security are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Energy security is an interdisciplinary concept. Its definitions leaves it vulnerable to exploitation as a justification for energy policy instruments. The extensive literature has yet to converge to formulate a unified definition of energy security and many outline a multitude of methods of measurement, such as the Supply/Demand index applied here in modified form, but also the Hirshman-Herfindahl Index, the Shannon Index for fuel diversity, and others. However, many of these index methods do not explicitly take into account the techno-economic interdependencies which influence energy security within the energy system. This paper reviews the literature to establish an energy security assessment method considering perspectives from sovereignty, infrastructural robustness, and market resilience. The aim of the paper is to provide a transparent data rich method and assessment of energy security by means of an application of a systemic energy security index to historical data and potential projected techno-economic energy system scenario analysis for a decarbonising Irish Energy System.},

abstract = {In this paper, the strategic technology options, especially the potential role of natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants, in mitigation of CO 2 emission in electricity sector in China are assessed. We analyse the influence of different power generation technologies on CO 2 emission volume and abatement cost based on energy market and electricity demand prospects, and least-cost expansion of electricity generating system. In the latter model, we take into account electricity supply quality and CO 2 emission. The CO 2 abatement cost is estimated in a period of time rather than the traditional abatement cost estimation performed for a target year. The proposed model is applied to the case of Shanghai Municipality in China to assess potential role of natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants in mitigation of CO 2 emission. Impact of the baseline technology choice on CO 2 abatement cost is analysed through the formulation of three scenarios. For the first one ("Baseline" scenario), it is assumed that expansion of the electricity supply system is based only on coal-fired power plants; for the second scenario, it is supposed that the decision makers have already envisaged the use of natural gas combined cycle power plants (CCPP) in addition to coal fired ones; the third scenario mixes coal-fired, natural gas CCPP and nuclear power plants. It is found that on the horizon of the study (2020), maximum CO 2 emission mitigation potential of natural gas CCPPs can reach 42.4 million tons (MtCO 2), whereas maximum CO 2 emission reduction potential of nuclear power plants can be 298.2 MtCO 2. The CO 2 abatement cost estimation falls into the range from US$19/tCO 2 to US$51/tCO 2 depending on the level of imposed CO 2 penalty, volume of carbon emission reduction and baseline technology choice. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The role of energy storage and transmission under various assumptions about a) development of electric battery costs, b) transmission grid expansion restrictions, and c) the variability of future electricity demand is demonstrated. Two models are soft-linked – LIBEMOD, a multimarket energy equilibrium model of Europe, and TIMES-Europe, a bottom-up stochastic model of the European electricity and district heat sectors – to provide an analysis of the decarbonization of the electricity sector that has consistent assumptions about electricity use and fuel prices. To explicitly value flexibility, a stochastic methodology is used to ensure that investment decisions take into account different operational situations that can occur due to weather-dependent renewable generation and the uncertainty of the electricity demand. It is demonstrated that the European power sector can be decarbonised with a 65%–70% share of the electricity supply from wind power and PV in 2050. The cost-efficient investment in stationary batteries is highly dependent on technology development in PV and expansion of the international transmission grid.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been identified by several studies as a promising option in the greenhouse gas mitigation portfolio of different countries. Since the Iberian Peninsula is a region with a large availability of renewable energy sources (RES), the role of CCS deserves deeper analysis. Using the TIMES_IBERIA optimization model, this paper investigates the contribution of several factors (i.e. climate policy, RES and CCS cost curves, and gas prices) that might promote or constrain the adoption of CCS technologies as part of a portfolio for reducing CO2 emissions from the power generation and industrial sector, in the medium-long term (2020-2050), within the Iberian Peninsula energy system.CCS becomes cost effective only after mature renewables, namely wind onshore and hydropower, are fully exploited up to their technical-economic potential. An ambitious long term climate target (-50% reduction in 2050 over 1990) contributes to an early penetration of CCS (in 2025). It penetrates more in the power sector (60% of captured emissions) than in industry (40%), and most of it is implemented in Spain (95%), not in Portugal. CCS penetration appears very sensitive to the costs of CCS technologies, while much less sensitive to the costs of renewable technologies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Projections of energy demand are important for energy security supply and low carbon futures, and usually rely on final energy consumption trends methods, limiting the opportunity for future options. Methods supported by energy services are much preferred to estimate future energy demand, since they are better suited to accomplish end-users needs. Final energy can then be assessed through complementary tools, as technological models, resulting in deeper knowledge on the relation between energy services and technology options.This paper presents a bottom-up methodology to project detailed energy end-uses demand in the Portuguese residential buildings until 2050, aiming to identify the parameters governing energy services demand uncertainty, through a sensitivity analysis. The partial equilibrium TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model was used to assess technology options and final energy needs for the range of parameters variations for each end-use, allowing to conclude on the impact of uncertainty of energy services demand in final energy.Main results show that technology can overweight behavioral practices and lifestyle changes for some end-uses as in space heating and lighting. Nevertheless, important focus should be given to uncertain parameters related with consumer behavior, especially those on heating and other electric end-uses, as thermal comfort and equipment's use. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study aims at determining the technology combination that provides the lowest emissions and energy cost for the food-industrial sector. Using a linear optimization objective function in determining the least-cost pathway, data from various sources were compiled to perform simulations on two scenarios; a business as usual (BAU) case and an 80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Even in the base case, the emission level reaches 21% of 1990 levels; a reduction of 39% over the simulation period. This indicates that even without the imposition of GHG constraints on the food sector, it is economically more beneficial for the industry to migrate from fossil fuels. This migration takes place by replacing energy from LPG, LFO, Kerosene, HFO, Coal and Natural gas with biomass, biogas and CHP electricity. Economic benefits arise from the fact that biogas and biomass are produced from wastes which are generated onsite within food factories, hence the avoidance of purchasing energy feedstock from the market. The change in energy consumption between the two scenarios is similar due to the prevalence of least-cost solutions and similar energy and food demand requirements. However, the reduction in emissions are greater in the 80%-GHG case than the BAU case; 52% compared to 39% for the BAU case, for 2050 relative to 2010. This is largely owing to decarbonization of grid electricity. This study finds that the food-industrial sector has the potential to exceed this 80% reduction target to a value of 92%, due to the availability of onsite feedstocks to generate biogas. In this simulation, of all waste produced, 92% of waste feedstock is consumed in AD and CHPs, whilst the remaining 8% is dried and processed to be burned in biomass boilers.},

abstract = {Until now, the complex relationship between energy security and climate change has been addressed using a partial understanding of security, one that is based on simplified indicators such as import dependence or fuel mix diversity. As a consequence, the synergies and trade-offs between climate change and energy security policies have not been systematically explored according to a wider understanding of the latter concept. The purpose of this article is to resolve the resulting knowledge gap by proposing a theoretical approach to energy security that is consistent with its multi-dimensional nature, taking into account the whole energy supply chain. Five key 'systemic' properties of energy security will be identified - namely, stability, flexibility, adequacy, resilience and robustness. The paper proposes a novel framework to assess energy security and uses this framework to develop a comprehensive approach to the interactions between climate change policies and energy security. The impact of a low-carbon scenario on one of these five properties (long-term robustness) will be assessed using a complex multi-regional energy system model. The results demonstrate how this scenario induces structural changes along the whole energy supply chain, revealing dynamic vulnerabilities and trade-offs that are not adequately accounted for by existing indicator-based assessments. Finally, the paper provides solid foundations for further analysis of these trade-offs using more detailed sectoral models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Starting from the premise that shale gas resource size and production cost are two key preconditions for its development, our scenario analysis reveals the way these and other variables interact with the global energy system, impacting on the regional distribution of gas production, interregional gas trade, demand and prices. The analysis shows how the reciprocal effects of substitutions on both the supply and demand-side play an important role in constraining or enabling the penetration of shale gas into the energy mix. Moreover, we systematically demonstrate that the global potential for shale gas development is contingent on a large number of intervening variables that manifest themselves in different ways across regionally-distinct energy systems. A simple theoretical model is derived from the results of the scenario analysis.Its purpose is to simplify and explain the complex behaviour of the system, by illustrating the chain of actions and feedbacks induced by different shale gas economics, their magnitude, their relative importance, and the necessary conditions for the global potential to be realised. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The increase in the share of renewable energy in the power generation mix plays a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of power systems, thus facilitating the achievement of international and national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change. Due to the intermittent nature of variable renewable energy, the integration of these sources in power systems requires investments in additional solutions and setting strategies to ensure grid stability and reliability. For that purpose, a prospective modelling was applied to the relatively isolated island named Procida, located in the gulf of Naples in Italy, through the bottom-up optimization model TIMES-Procida for a long-term energy plan where technical solutions, i.e., deployment of photovoltaics on rooftops and storage, and policy scenarios, i.e., energy efficiency, were used to analyse the evolution of the energy system. The introduction of renewable energy could be much more relevant when dealing with islands; they appear as decisive territories for experimentation and analysis of the transformation of all power systems. At year 2050, our results address decarbonisation and energy autonomy. They show that only with high shares of renewable energy will the territory see a noticeable decarbonisation of its economic sectors (up to 24%) and a decreasing dependency on imports (−16.6% compared to low renewable integration). By comparing the results of scenarios including or lacking storage solutions, we showcased how this reflected on the investments in PV and on grid congestion relief.},

abstract = {The global trend is constantly increasing investments in strategic sectors of the economy, for example the electric power industry, which, in many countries, is becoming diversified and dispersed due to the multitude of entities investing in energy production and renewable resources, which leads to an increase in the heterogeneity of investment decisions. There is an urgent need to control the movement of investments, budget funds, as well as their development in the process of implementing investment programs of energy companies. The control of the movement of investments is the most promising direction of studying the subject of finance and audit. The increasing volume of public and private targeted investments in the energy sector and the lack of control over the effectiveness of investment projects (since each program contains several thousand lists of projects) necessitated the introduction of additional regulation of budget spending. The development of a mathematical apparatus for such regulation led to the creation in the Russian Federation of an institute of an independent public technological and price audit (TPA). The TPA is seen as a mechanism to ensure an effective project evaluation and selection process. This article describes methodological improvements using power system optimization models. The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) was developed as part of the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program of the IEA-ETSAP, an international community that uses long-term energy scenarios to conduct in-depth energy and environmental analyzes. This approach includes two different but complementary systematic approaches to energy modeling: an engineering approach and an economic approach. The same approach is used when conducting a TSA, when an investment object is evaluated as a set of technological and price parameters. The article considers a model of resource allocation in the energy sector and a mechanism for using TPA for investment projects with state participation in a natural monopoly. An approach to the financial and long-term distribution of investments of electric power companies based on the search for a balance of interests of the supplier and consumer and available energy sources is proposed. A model has been developed to find the optimal plan of technical solutions, taking into account the balance of the possibilities of the electric power industry and the needs of the economy. The relevance of the article is due to the requirements of investment efficiency, since the prevailing share in the costs is occupied by the costs of equipment and the construction of power plants.},

abstract = {The concept of 'grid parity' has emerged as a key indicator of the competitiveness of renewable electricity generation technologies. In this study, we firstly summarize the definition of the current levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) based methodology for the concept and address its limitation in not taking into account the systematic changes in an electric power system. Secondly, we introduce a bottom-up energy system model based methodology to overcome the limitation. Lastly, we apply the methodology to a case study, the grid parity analysis of solar photovoltaic and onshore wind technologies in the Korean electric power system, to highlight the differences between the results obtained using both methodologies. The results of the study show three implications. First, even if the LCOE of onshore wind is already lower than that of natural gas technologies and the average price of grid electricity, the LCOE is required to be much lower to achieve cost-competitiveness in the electric power system. Second, different technologies might be required to have different LCOE levels to be cost-competitive in the same power system. Third, a policy or plan for the deployment of renewable energy technologies must be harmonized with other policies and plans within the same system.},

As these production modes have a lower energy density, their development will imply an increase in the amount of land dedicated to electricity production. This study investigates the links between an optimal decarbonization of the electricity system, land requirements, and the development strategy of interconnections. We study these interactions using eTIMES-EU, an energy system optimization model, by endogenously taking into account a land variable and testing two interconnection development plans. Our results show that it is possible to limit the land use of the network to its 2020 value for roughly a one percent higher total discounted cost, and that the development of interconnections changes the technologies to be installed on a European scale, but that it requires efficient and ambitious planning. Moreover, our results highlight disparities across countries in terms of space and investment that may constitute barriers to implementing this type of centralized development policy.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the long-term prospects of alternative fuels in global personal transport. It aims at assessing key drivers and key bottlenecks for their deployment, focusing particularly on the role of biofuels and hydrogen in meeting climate policy objectives. The analysis is pursued using the Global Multi-regional MARKAL model (GMM), a perfect foresight "bottom-up" model of the global energy system with a detailed representation of alternative fuel chains, linked to the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC). The analysis shows that biofuels are limited by the regional availability of low-cost biomass, but can be important for meeting mild climate policy targets. If policy-makers intend to pursue more stringent climate policy, then hydrogen becomes a competitive option. However, the analysis finds that the use of hydrogen in personal transport is restricted to very stringent climate policy, as only such policy provides enough incentive to build up the required delivery infrastructure. An analysis of costs additionally shows that "keeping the hydrogen option open" does not take considerable investments compared to the investment needs in the power sector within the next decades, but allows the use of hydrogen for the pursuit of stringent climate policy in the second half of the century. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Paris Agreement, entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain the global average temperature raising below 2°C, countries that have ratified the agreement should declare their contribution to reducing GHG emissions. one of the most important components contributing to global GHG emissions is the transportation sector. The GHG emission from the transportation sector is 84.7 Mton CO2eq. which accounts for 16% of the total GHG emissions throughout Turkey in 2017. Road transportation with a rate of 93%, corresponds to the biggest share of GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the current study, GHG emissions were modelled from 2016 to 2050, in order to assess the impacts of the transportation sector on climate change in Istanbul, which is the most populous city and has the highest number of vehicles in Turkey. Istanbul has a major importance for Turkey, from the point of its energy consumption and climate-related emissions. For this purpose, the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) as a technology-rich and economic model was used. The results of the study were obtained for the reference scenario, which assumes that the existing plans and policies will continue until 2050. Furthermore, three alternative scenarios were studied which are related to electric rail transportation (Scenario 1), electric and hybrid cars (Scenario 2) and limited CO2 emissions (Scenario 3). Results show that the total GHG reduction is 1.1% Scenario 1, 11% for Scenario 2 and 39% for Scenario 3 in 2050. In the third scenario where the emission limitation was introduced to the model, there was a trend towards vehicles with higher amounts of LPG and CNG to keep the emission at the desired level, and fuel consumption was approximately 5.5% higher than the reference scenario in 2050.},

abstract = {Integrated assessment models are generally not constrained by raw materials supply. In this article, the interactions between a wide diffusion of electric vehicles in the world transportation sector and the lithium supply are analysed in the Times Integrated Assessment Model (TIAM-IFPEN version). The lithium sector and a detailed representation of the transportation sector have been then implemented into the TIAM-IFPEN processes constituting the global energy system. Hence, the availability of this strategic material to supply the growing demand for low-carbon technologies in the context of the energy transition can be questioned. Incorporating an endogenous representation of the lithium supply chain allows investigating its dynamic criticality depending on several optimal technology paths that represent different climate and/or mobility scenarios between 2005 and 2050. It is the first detailed global bottom-up energy model with an endogenous disaggregated raw materials supply chain. Based on our simulations, the geological, geopolitical and economic dimensions of criticality are discussed. Four scenarios have been run: two climate scenarios (4 °C and 2 °C) with two shapes of mobility each: a high mobility where we consider the impact of urban dispersal with a huge car dependence/usage, and a low mobility in which the demand for individual road transport is lower due to a more sustainable urban planning and more public transport. The electric vehicles fleet should reach up to 1/3 of global fleet by 2050 in the 4 °C scenarios, while it could be up to 3/4 in the 2 °C scenarios both with high mobility, mostly located in Asian countries (China, India and other developing countries in Asia) due to the large presence of 2 and 3-wheelers. The penetration of electric vehicles has a major impact on lithium market. The cumulated demand over the period 2005–2050 reaches up to 53% of the current resources in the 2 °C scenario with a high mobility. These results tend to show an absence of geological criticality. Nevertheless, they have clearly highlighted other different forms of vulnerabilities, whether economic, industrial, geopolitical or environmental. A discussion about the future risk factors on the lithium market is done at a regional scale aiming at analysing more in-depth the impact of the electric vehicle on lithium market. Our study of this particular strategic material shows that the model could be a useful decision-making tool for assessing future raw material market in the context of the energy transition and could be extended to other critical raw materials for more efficient regional and sectorial screening.},

The TIMES-DK model was further developed to concurrently represent all emerging transport technologies (ETTs) in road- and off-road transport applications, disaggregated transport technologies and service demands segmentation to capture consumers preferences and heterogeneity, and to endogenise fuel infrastructures. The model runs optimise the societal surplus in between 2010 and 2050. There is a particular focus on the role of gas in transport. The results reveal that in between 2020 and 2040, natural gas (NG) could cost-efficiently serve as a transition fuel. Decarbonisation pace and fuel infrastructure assumptions were found to have a large impact on the NG adoption levels. This study showed that the combined use of liquid biofuels (mainly biomethanol), upgraded biogas, electricity, and hydrogen fuels would deliver cost-effective deep decarbonisation by 2050; however, their various decarbonisation roles vary within and across transport segments. Depending on the decarbonisation pace, a marginal CO2 abatement cost of 419–549 €/ton (or 1–1.29 €/L gasoline) is required by 2050 in Denmark. The results also showed that 25% and 30% cost reductions of BEVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), compared to our central cost assumptions, would increase their respective adoption by 36% and 66% towards 2050. They show high market shares particularly in the medium size segment than in the small and large segments. Competition for limited biomass resources coupled with higher fuel demand results in adoption of ETTs.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore potential least-cost decarbonisation solutions for an off-grid and offshore fish farm power supply system under long term uncertainty. The Hinn{\o}ya island in Norway is used as a use case. Three distinctive off-grid and grid-based alternative power supply solutions were proposed and studied as a replacement to the existing diesel power solution in a three-stage stochastic model and under two critical long-term uncertainties: (1) access to strong grid and (2) storage battery cost. The TIMES modelling framework is applied. The stochastic model results reveal that grid integrated storage is an optimal near-term investment for a storage battery cost of 295 €/kWh and less by 2025. In scenarios with no access to strong grid, grid integrated storage continues to be a least-cost solution in the long-term as well, whereas in those scenarios with strong grid access, new investment in storage is not required after 2030. Contrary to the stochastic model runs, the equivalent deterministic model runs showed that a hybrid wind and diesel solution is an optimal near-term investment. From 2030, however, a similar technology pattern in both stochastic and deterministic model runs are observed. Nevertheless, the results are very sensitive to the assumed storage battery costs. Higher storage costs (as high as 704 €/kWh by 2025) would make the hybrid wind and diesel solution an optimal solution instead of the grid integrated storage solution in near-term investment in both stochastic and deterministic model runs.},

Since electricity consumption forms about a fifth of the total energy consumption, and directly impacts the country's economy and people's well-being, it is necessary to pay emphasis on Malaysia's long-term power sector planning by identifying sustainable options which will enhance Malaysia's energy security and mitigate climate change. This paper presents an analysis of the long-term power generation options for Malaysia by deploying the integrated MARKAL-EFOM system (TIMES) model. The examined scenarios are business as usual (BAU) and optimized least cost scenarios which include: existing technology, plus renewable, plus nuclear as well as, plus photovoltaic (PV) and storage. The results indicated that Malaysia has sufficient renewable energy resources to meet the projected electricity demand by 2050 and fossil fuels can be fully replaced with electricity sourced from large hydropower and combination of other indigenous sustainable energy sources. The variability issue of renewables can be stabilized with the integration of storage systems into the grid. This analysis also demonstrated that installation of 8.57 GW solar PV panels on existing rooftops combined with 3.6 GW large-scale pumped heat energy storage (PHES) system can generate electricity comparable to a 2.0 GW nuclear plant at a lower system cost of $102.4 billion. Hence, if Malaysia were to adopt a sustainable policy, then nuclear power would not be an ideal option as uranium fuel relies on continuous imports.},

An economic assessment on two baseload power plants is included to evaluate the investment viability. The results indicated that the BAU and NUC2 scenario are unsustainable as the dependency on fossil fuel for electrical power generation by 2050 is still high at 71.92% and 66.83% respectively. Contrariwise, the RNW6S7 scenario revealed a low carbon profile for power generation in Malaysia by 2050, whereby the emissions have declined to a minimum level of 11,490 kt which is equivalent to 92.45% of avoided CO2 in contrast to the BAU levels. The low carbon state is attained due to 98.37% of the generation output is renewable electricity. Finally, the RNW6S7 scenario demonstrated that the CO2 emissions in 2030 will drop by 46.22% relative to the 2005 levels which from the power sector perspective surpassed the Paris Agreement targets.},

A list of all referenced models is presented and the literature is analysed with regards sectoral coverage and technological inclusion, as well as mathematical structure of models.The paper compares available models using an appropriate classification schema, the introduction of which is aimed at making the model landscape more accessible and perspicuous, thereby enhancing the diversity of models within use. The distinct classification presented in this paper comprises three sections, which specify the model purpose and structure, technological detail and mathematical approach. The schema is not designed to be comprehensive, but rather to be a broad classification with pertinent level of information required to differentiate between models.As an example, the UK model landscape is considered and 22 models are classified in three tables, as per the proposed schema.},

Population growth and sustained economic growth will make India to one of the biggest economies in the world, consuming huge amounts of energy. The study shows that India would consume in 2100 a third of the global electricity demand of 2000. If no intervention are considered, coal will keep its position as dominant source in the electricity sector throughout the whole 21st century. This would result in tremendous CO2 emissions. The picture changes completely, if stringent restrictions on CO2 emissions are applied. In the case of strict emission reductions new technologies like fusion could make an inroad to the Indian energy system.

As part of the PPCS (Power Plant Conceptual Study) in Europe, published in 2005, an assessment was made of the likely economic performance of the range of fusion power plant concepts studied. Since that time, new work has been carried out, within the fusion programme, and particularly in the EU DEMO study, that changes a number of the important assumptions made in the PPCS. These changes allow either reduced cost versions of the PPCS plant models or, alternatively, plants with less ambitious technical assumptions at constant cost. The impact of the new results, emerging from the EU DEMO studies, on the role of fusion in the future energy market is described. A new energy economics model is employed to analyse the potential market performance of fusion power in a range of future energy scenarios and this shows that there can be a significant role for fusion in a future energy market. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {This study provides a review of the emergence of hydrogen within low-carbon pathways from different integrated energy system models. The objective is to understand the drivers and policy scenarios that lead to the emergence of hydrogen over other low-carbon technologies. The review is divided into global, multi-regional and national integrated energy system models with drivers, marginal abatement costs and timing of hydrogen emergence assessed. Hydrogen's use in energy systems is complex as a result of its relationship with other energy sources. It was found that bioenergy can act as both a competitor and driver for hydrogen energy, along with increased electrification and high renewable electricity scenarios. However, electric vehicles are a main competitor in the passenger vehicle sector. In reviewed results, hydrogen mainly emerges after 2030; although, some technologies emerge as early as 2020 and as late as 2050. The uncertainty and complexity surrounding hydrogen may be as a result of the difficulty of representing hydrogen technologies and systems in energy system models. This study can allow policy makers to assess the various options to be considered regarding hydrogen and make informed decisions for moving towards a decarbonised energy system.},

This target has been set at a minimum of 80% reduction relative to 1990 levels, to be achieved by 2050. The Act also creates the need to set a series of carbon budgets, which chart the course to achieving the long term 2050 targets via a series of intermediate steps. This report forms part of the evidence base to support government decisions relating to the 4 th carbon budget period, which runs from 2023 to 2027. The investigation presented draws on the MARKAL model of the UK energy system. The MARKAL approach is a widely recognised and internationally supported model that allows the investigator to consider ideal pathways for energy system change, under decarbonisation constraints, in a technology-rich framework with sound economic basis. MARKAL finds the pathway of energy system change that maximises combined consumer and producer surplus, via consideration of technologies, conservation measures, upstream resources, and the reaction of consumers to changes in energy price. The UK MARKAL database contains more than 1,000 resources, conversion technologies and end-use technologies, all of which are considered by the model in choosing the " best " combination of measures and timing of their implementation to achieve the required abatement.},

abstract = {Estimates of the magnitude of CO2 emissions reduction brought about by an intervention in the energy system are important because they signal which interventions are the most potent in terms of climate change mitigation. Yet quantifying emissions changes is not trivial because interventions act on the margin of the energy system, rather than acting on all components of the whole energy system equally. Therefore, in order to accurately attribute outcomes to interventions, the specific energy system changes precipitated by the intervention should be estimated, along with the corresponding change in emissions. This paper builds on previous research in this regard estimating short-run marginal emissions factors in national electricity systems. It presents the concept of the long-run marginal emissions factor (LR-MEF), and builds and applies a new electricity system model to study the problem. For the British electricity system it is found that the average LR-MEF is approximately 0.26-0.53kgCO2/kWh for the coming decade, but this reduces to approximately zero by 2035 and onwards as the system decarbonises. Furthermore, it is found that the LR-MEF can diverge very significantly from the short-run. This highlights the state of flux of the British electricity system and the importance of taking structural changes in the electricity system into account when attributing emissions reduction to interventions. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

Four setups where a bottom-up linear programming model is hard-linked with a top-down computable general equilibrium model are implemented. A solution is found by iterating between the two models, until convergence is reached. The same equilibrium solution is found by all hard-linked setups in all problem instances. Next, one integrated model is introduced by extending the computable general equilibrium mixed complementarity model with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that represent the bottom-up linear programming model. This integrated model provides the same solutions as the hard-linked models. Also, an alternative integrated model is provided, where the bottom-up model objective is optimized while the top-down model is included as additional constraints. This nonlinear program corresponds to a multi-follower bilevel formulation, with the energy system model as the leader and the general equilibrium players (firms and household) as followers. The Stackelberg equilibrium from this bilevel formulation pareto-dominates the Nash equilibrium from the other model setups in some problem instances, and is identical in the remaining problem instances. Different ways to couple the mathematical models may result in different solutions, because the coupling represents different real-world situations.},

A TIMES model for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator footprint using publicly available data was used to examine system integration costs and emissions savings benefits of high penetration of intermittent renewable electricity. TIMES is a bottom-up optimization model that minimizes the total system cost. The number of time slices was increased to capture wind and solar generation dynamics, to better understand spinning reserves costs, and to allow battery storage. Using candidate sites for solar and wind generation, transmission, investment and production costs were added. Total system costs increased as there were higher transmission and spinning reserve costs. The emissions savings of Carbon Dioxide equivalent, Sulphur Dioxide, and Particulate Matter were converted to economic benefits using the Social Costs of Emissions. As the penetration of wind and solar generation increases, emissions savings and economic benefits increase. The system integration costs are greater than the benefits of emissions savings. The economic benefits do not justify the system integration cost increases.},

Building on established emissions reduction scenarios, a financial model is developed from an integrated energy system model to understand the financial risks associated with continued investment in gas networks.

To capture feedbacks from impacted natural or socio-economic systems requires interactive two-way coupling, but this is generally computationally infeasible with even moderately complex general circulation models (GCMs). Dimension reduction using emulation is one solution to this problem, demonstrated here with the GCM PLASIM-ENTS (Planet Simulator coupled with the efficient numerical terrestrial scheme). Our approach generates temporally evolving spatial patterns of climate variables, considering multiple modes of variability in order to capture non-linear feedbacks. The emulator provides a 188-member ensemble of decadally and spatially resolved (∼ 5° resolution) seasonal climate data in response to an arbitrary future CO2 concentration and non-CO 2 radiative forcing scenario. We present the PLASIM-ENTS coupled model, the construction of its emulator from an ensemble of transient future simulations, an application of the emulator methodology to produce heating and cooling degree-day projections, the validation of the simulator (with respect to empirical data) and the validation of the emulator (with respect to high-complexity models).

In this analysis, a bottom-up energy system model for the residential heating sector has been built with the model generator TIMES and expanded by findings on consumer behaviour. The model is used to investigate the effect of consumer behaviour on residential space heating demand in Austria from 2007 to 2030, and to quantify the implications on possible future energy savings. Model results show that (1) energy demand for residential heating is slightly decreasing, (2) consumer behaviour greatly affects energy demand, (3) neglecting consumer behaviour leads to a significant overestimation of possible energy savings due to building-standard improvement. This analysis provides a better understanding of the interaction between thermal improvements of buildings and consumer behaviour and enables better founded outlooks on possible future energy savings.},

Alternative policies on CO 2 emission constraints reduce the burden of imported fuel, improve energy security and reduce environmental impacts. The results show that the introduction of the CO 2 emission reduction targets and carbon tax directly affect the shift of technologies from high carbon content fossil-based to low carbon content fossil-based and clean solar PV technologies compared to the base scenario. The cumulative net energy imports during 2005-2035 would be reduced in the range of 33-61% compared to the base scenario. The total primary energy requirement would be reduced in the range of 4.5-22.37% and the primary energy supply system would be diversified. Solar PV plays an important role in achieving reasonable energy security. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The authors propose an alternative, investment-led approach to analysing the potential for the development of hydrogen energy in the UK. The UK economy is relatively sensitive to movements in world fossil fuels markets since the energy sector contributes at least 5% of UK GDP and represents an asset pool of at least {\pounds}230 billion. Much of the ongoing research to assess possible scenarios for the development of alternatives to existing energy systems, including hydrogen energy, in the UK is built around the cost-optimising MARKAL model. The authors believe that this approach offers an incomplete picture of hydrogen energy deployment since it ignores the mechanisms dictating the flow of commercial capital to the sector and they suggest an alternative model based on the risk-adjusted value proposition. Initial analysis shows that valuation differentials already exist between companies in the fossil fuel, utilities and fuel cell sectors and that this might be exploited to the advantage of investors thus affecting the speed of development in hydrogen energy. It should be noted that the following represents work in progress and the authors intend to publish an extended analysis in due course. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

abstract = {Historically, land use in Britain has been shaped by the environment's capacity to provide energy as well as food, water and shelter. Over the next decades, energy will again become a major driver in land cover change as we seek to capture the necessary energy to replace fossil fuels, reduce environmental damage and substitute for insecure supplies. Britain was one of the first places to exploit fossil fuels extensively, initially coal, and it has the potential to generate considerable amounts of renewable energy from tides, waves, the wind, biomass and sunlight. The UK Government's policy is to develop a suite of technologies that will provide a resilient supply without compromising its economy or its international commitments to environmental protection. This paper examines the three major terrestrial options for renewable energy and assesses each by successively filtering them for feasibility, achievability and practicality incorporating existing developments, designation and public opinion. Technology and opinion are dynamic, so the outputs need to be viewed as indicative of alternative scenarios rather than as fixed forecasts. Implications for changes in the energy supply infrastructure needed to match the new supply chains are highlighted. The demand for energy depends on the demographic profile (population size, age distribution, lifestyle and expectations) and on economic activity. Here total demand is predicted using the UK Energy Research Centre's Energy 2050 model, which uses linear programming to balance economics and environmental capacity by major demand sectors in five-year time steps. The core model often generates challenging results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.},

abstract = {This paper approximates the emissions rebound effects. 1As per Binswanger (2001), we take the " rebound effect" to be defined in broad terms. In this paper we refer generally to the " emissions rebound" It is taken to mean the increase in emissions due to the introduction of some measure which is lower in cost and emissions than business as usual practice. associated with substituting expensive and GHG emitting natural gas (LNG) power plants, with apparently cheaper and lower emitting nuclear plant. It then evaluates the effect this has on economy wide electricity use as well as net GHG emissions changes.The analysis is undertaken by combining aspects of an input-output model with an optimizing energy systems model.The scope of the case study is limited to the effects of the electricity sector (and its emissions) on the Korean economy from 2005 to 2030. Its primary basis (in terms of data and assumptions) is the recent national Basic Plan for Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand (KPX, 2006).2That work extends only to 2020, but for this effort is extrapolated using consistent assumptions to 2030. KPX (2006) describes a national power expansion plan developed by the Korea Power exchange and does not include any specific technology focus. The cases considered a limited increase of the share of Advanced Pressurised Reactor (APR) nuclear plant at the expense of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant running on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG).Three scenarios are studied, based on KPX (2006). These include (1) a Reference scenario,. 3The reference case is not the least cost case in a pure sense: as determined by the KPX (2006) planning process, it is the least cost case subject to a political (neither economic nor technical) constraint on upper limit of nuclear power. In related work, a soft technical limit-which is significantly higher-is estimated (IAEA, 2006a,b). It is also entirely possible that site considerations may force another technical limit which is not considered here. Current work indicates that sites have been identified for the next ten nuclear power plants, see: OPR 1000 (2008) and APR 1400 (2008), with investigation for further sites or site expansion currently taking place. (2) a Mitigation scenario (where an extra 5000. MW of nuclear is allowed to enter the system at the expense of LNG plant, but no emissions rebound is calculated) and (3) a Mitigation+rebound scenario (where some emissions savings of the extra nuclear plant are offset by an emissions rebound).4Using the IO-Optimization model developed, a feedback mechanism is introduced. This would invoke the use of offsetting GHG emitting technologies, if for some reason (directly and indirectly), the effect of the increased introduction of nuclear power was to increase the demand for electricity. To achieve this, there is a limit placed on the introduction of new nuclear. If that nuclear power is introduced (to its limit) and demand for electricity increases it must be met by other power plants. In the Korean system, the other power plants that are economic in our scenarios are CO2 emitting fossil plant. Interestingly while our limit is arbitrary and conservative, there are technical limits associated with the characteristics of the power system which would limit nuclear, albeit at a higher level of about 60% of total generation (IAEA, 2006b).The modelling approach developed is useful as it provides a method of including and indicating some economic interactions with the energy system in a relatively transparent manner. Stand alone economic models can lack energy system dynamics, while energy systems model are often decoupled from detailed economic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 IAEA.},

A key feature of the OSeMOSYS implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of OSeMOSYS and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the OSeMOSYS community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the LEAP model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The effect of multi-pollutant regulations such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) upon these decisions and costs is also considered.We use decision trees to structure the problem, defining multiple futures for each uncertainty and then simulating how the U.S. energy market responds to them. A two-stage stochastic version of the energy-economy model MARKAL simulates the market. Relative importance of the uncertainties is assessed using two indices: expected cost of ignoring uncertainty (ECIU) and expected value of perfect information (EVPI). We also calculate the value of policy coordination (VPC), the cost saved by avoiding surprise changes in policy. An example shows how a stochastic program can be used to compute these indices. The analysis shows that the possibility of greenhouse gas regulation is the most important uncertainty by these measures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Unlike previous research of green utilization behavior, this study established a dynamic adjustment mechanism for the government's subsidy policy for electric vehicles through the case study of Taiwan's electric motorcycle, so that the government's finite budget can be effectively allocated. Results indicate that emerging energy technologies reach the market competition conditions of economies of scale through government subsidy, subsidy policies should gradually phase out the market and transfer finite budgets to other emerging energy technologies that need to break through economies of scale. Therefore, the incentives phase-out mechanism of the electric motorcycle in this study will be helpful in the decision-making thinking of government and quantitative evaluation for the promotion of emerging energy technologies in the future.},

abstract = {Low-carbon power generation technologies such as wind, solar and carbon capture and storage are expected to play major roles in a decarbonized world. However, currently high cost may weaken the competitiveness of these technologies. One important cost reduction mechanism is the “learning by doing”, through which cumulative deployment results in technology costs decline. In this paper, a 14-region global energy system model (Global TIMES model) is applied to assess the impacts of technology diffusion on power generation portfolio and CO2 emission paths out to the year 2050. This analysis introduces three different technology learning approaches, namely standard endogenous learning, multiregional learning and multi-cluster learning. Four types of low-carbon power generation technologies (wind, solar, coal-fired and gas-fired CCS) undergo endogenous technology learning. The modelling results show that: (1) technology diffusion can effectively reduce the long-term abatement costs and the welfare losses caused by carbon emission mitigation; (2) from the perspective of global optimization, developed countries should take the lead in low-carbon technologies' deployment; and (3) the establishment of an effective mechanism for technology diffusion across boundaries can enhance the capability and willingness of developing countries to cut down their CO2 emission.},

This paper undertakes a methodological review of a selection of UK and international low carbon scenario studies, using a typology of 'trend based', 'technical feasibility' and 'modelling' studies. Dominant methodologies in such studies have been the 2 × 2 axis and the 'back-casting' approach. Strengths of the studies reviewed include technological detail, and identification of key economic and social constraints. Weaknesses include the over-reliance on constructs such as exogenous emissions constraints, and high level trends, which diminish the ability to understand how the various future scenarios could be brought about or avoided. This is compounded by the lack of depiction of specific system actors; the tendency to abstract policy from the scenarios; and the resulting failure to consider policy, technology and behaviour in an iterative, 'co-evolving' fashion. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, controversial issues have emerged, especially on avoided GHG emissions, raising uncertainties regarding its future development. For an actor, investing in the appropriate pathway is yet not straightforward as resource availability, process efficiency and costs are uncertain and regulatory framework will impact future technological choices among current, second or third generation production processes. A better understanding of the dynamic of the whole industry is thus needed for informed policy. This paper relies on a TIMES prospective model of French bioenergy sector we developed that gives a dynamic technology allocation under constraints. We find that avoided emissions of the biofuel sector could range from 12 MtCO2eq for current regulatory context to 16 MtCO2eq for the future one. The higher is the mitigation level, the higher is the associated abatement cost: from less than 200 €/tCO2eq to more than 6000 €/tCO2eq as it would imply the development of advanced processes, such as algae biofuels. Externalities play a significant role on the technology merit order, and must also be considered for designing future incentive policy.},

The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization (EEO) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis. We present the algebraic formulation of Temoa and conduct a verification exercise by implementing a simple test system in both Temoa and MARKAL, a widely used commercial model of the same type. In addition, a stochastic optimization of the test system is presented as a proof-of-concept application of uncertainty analysis using the Temoa framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper compares North American results from 17 models and discusses their policy motivation. Oil and natural gas production in the three major countries are modestly sensitive to crude oil and natural gas price changes, although these elasticities are below unity. Carbon taxes displace coal and some natural gas with renewables within all three power markets. Lower natural gas prices replace coal and some renewables with natural gas within electric generation. Higher intermittent renewable penetration in the power sector displaces coal and some natural gas. A key conclusion is that much remains to be done in integrating future analyses and in sharing and improving the quality and consistency of the underlying data.},

abstract = {To make an active contribution to the global effort in mitigation of climate change, Taiwan government has implemented the "Frameworks for Sustainable Energy Policy-An Energy-Saving and Carbon-Reduction Action Plan" in June 2008. It has made a commitment of a stepwise reduction of nationwide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which returns the nationwide GHG emission to 2008 levels by 2020, then reduces to 2000 levels by 2025, and finally cuts 50% of 2000 levels by 2050. The fundamental strategy is to reduce the GHG emission under acceptable economic development and energy security to achieve generation-spanning triple-win in energy, environment and economy. The major policy instruments such as "Statute for Renewable Energy Development", "GHG Reduction Law (draft)," "Regulation for Energy Tax (draft)," and "Energy Management Act" have been either implemented or scheduled for legislative reviewing. The purpose of this paper is to present an updated review of the outcomes of GHG emission reduction in Taiwan. In addition, the progress and priority of policy instruments in GHG emission reduction are analyzed as well. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the passenger-car sector in Japan are increasing rapidly and should be reduced cost-effectively in order to stabilize energy-related CO2 emissions in Japan. The purpose of the present paper is to clarify the most cost-effective mix of vehicles for reducing CO2 emissions and to estimate the subsidy that is necessary to achieve this vehicle mix. For this analysis, the energy system of Japan from 1988 to 2032 is modeled using a MARKAL model. The most cost-effective mix of vehicles is estimated by minimizing the total energy system cost under the constraint of an 8% energy-related CO2 emissions reduction nationally by 2030 from the CO2 emissions of 1990. Based on the results of the analysis, hybrid vehicles are the only type of clean-energy vehicle, and their share of the passenger car sector in 2030 will be 62%. By assuming the subsidization of hybrid vehicles, the same vehicle mix can be achieved without constraining CO2 emissions. The peak of the total subsidy estimated to be necessary is 1.225 billion US$/year in 2020, but the annual revenue of the assumed 31 US$/t-C carbon tax from the passenger car sector is sufficient to finance the estimated subsidy. This suggests that we should support the dissemination of hybrid vehicles through subsidization based on carbon tax. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As climate negotiators work towards a deal that would limit the increase in global temperatures, interest is growing in the essential role technology innovation can and must play in enabling the transition to a low-carbon energy system. Indeed, recent success stories clearly indicate that there is significant and untapped potential for accelerating innovation in clean technologies if proper policy frameworks are in place. In an especially timely analysis, the 2015 edition of Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP 2015) examines innovation in the energy technology sector and seeks to increase confidence in the feasibility of achieving short- and long-term climate change mitigation targets through effective research, development, demonstration and deployment (RDD&D). ETP 2015 identifies regulatory strategies and co‑operative frameworks to advance innovation in areas like variable renewables, carbon capture and storage, and energy-intensive industrial sectors. The report also shows how emerging economies, and China in particular, can foster a low-carbon transition through innovation in energy technologies and policy. Finally, ETP 2015 features the IEA annual Tracking Clean Energy Progress report, which this year shows that efforts to decarbonise the global energy sector are lagging further behind. By setting out pathways to a sustainable energy future and by incorporating detailed and transparent quantitative modelling analysis and well-rounded commentary, ETP 2015 and its series of related publications are required reading for experts in the energy field, policy makers and heads of governments, as well as business leaders and investors.},

The aim of this work is to assess the technical and economic potential of Demand Side Management (DSM) in Nigeria given different future levels of industrialisation. The paper places industrialisation at the centrefold of the appraisal of DSM potential in Nigeria. It does so by designing industrialisation scenarios and consequently deriving different DSM penetration levels using a cost-optimisation model. Findings show that under the high industrialisation scenario by the year 2050 DSM could bring about 7 billion USD in cumulative savings thanks to deferred investment in new generation and full deployment of standby assets along with interruptible programmes for larger industrial users. The paper concludes by providing policy recommendations regarding financial mechanisms to increase DSM deployment in Nigeria. The focus on DSM serves to shift the policy debate on electricity in Nigeria from a static state versus market narrative on supply to an engagement with the agency and influence on industrial end-users.},

abstract = {The energy balance of Greece is strongly dependent on imported oil. The rather late introduction of natural gas has increased the diversity of the energy mix while the share of renewable sources in primary energy supply still needs to increase according to the existing potential. Yet, Greece as one of the most of the EU developed countries encounters a serious task: the need to increase its electricity production of almost 5% per year but at the same time to reduce the CO2 emissions according with the National and International (20-20-20) regulations and allocation plans. Therefore reducing CO2 emissions has become a major priority for national government. In addition, from 2013, there will be the full implementation of the wholesale market in the European Trading Scheme (ETS) which is currently in the last stages of a transition phase. In Greece electricity is mainly generated from lignite, thus making the electricity sector one of the main contributors to GHG emissions with a level above 40% of the total country and higher than the corresponding average of the rest of the EU countries. The possible implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies would then become very decisive due to the large use of the lignite as fuel in the country electricity mix. CCS technology has the potential of increasing the flexibility on the achievement greenhouse gas emissions reduction by allowing to continue to use fossil fuels, which still guarantees feasibility in the energy sector. This work presents a roadmap with the modeling of the main technologies associated to the CCS and its implementation into the Greek energy system considering existing National and International Strategic energy plans under different scenarios. The implementation of CCS technologies would have a large influence on the national electrical power production, having the responsibility for large shares of the emissions reduction that can potentially achieved in this sector. For this purpose, TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL/EFOM System) has been chosen as the principal tool for building a technoeconomic model of the Greek energy system and its possible evaluation over time (2040). {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {With a vibrant economic development, Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA) would need to boast low-carbon electricity generation, reduce carbon emissions, and re-structure transportation, yet having no energy management plan. The main objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing energy impacts and macroeconomic effects of low-carbon scenarios and to identify a sustainable pathway towards 2050 for GKMA. The study uses TIMES/CGE hybrid framework to address the knowledge gap in 4 scenarios. Business as usual is the reference case with Kabejja (20% CO2 abatement), Carbon-Tax (100$/ton), and Lutta (95% CO2 abatement) as alternative scenarios. The analysis shows an increase in consumption from 139.6PJ to 469.35PJ and carbon emissions from 4.6mtns to 7mtns in the reference case. However, consumption and carbon emissions decrease in all the alternative scenarios compared to the reference case. The GDP and equivalent variation (EV) in household welfare increase in all alternative scenarios compared to the reference case. Lutta promises a 60.6% reduction in the carbon emissions intensity of GDP to be realistic. Sustainability is achievable when low-carbon electricity becomes the major contributor to the demand by fuel type, optimization of the total primary energy supply, and construction of an electrified Kampala metro. Transportation, Industrial and Residential sectors are the greatest emitters of CO2 by sector in all scenarios and thus need policy interventions to realize deep CO2 emissions reductions. The study recommends that Lutta guarantee a sustainable low-carbon footprint for GKMA.},

The UK MARKAL technology-focused energy systems dynamic cost optimisation model-which has been used to quantify the costs and benefits of alternative energy strategies in UK policy making-is enhanced with detailed representation of bio-energy chains and end-uses. This provides an important advance in linking bioenergy expert-knowledge with a whole system modelling approach, in order to better understand the potential role of bioenergy in an evolving energy system. The new BIOSYS-MARKAL model is used to run four scenarios constructed along the pillars of UK energy policy objectives (low carbon and energy security). The results are analysed in terms of bioenergy resources use and bioenergy pathways penetration in different end use sectors. The main findings suggest that the complexity of different bioenergy pathways may have been overlooked in previous modelling exercises. A range of bioenergy pathways-notably bio-heat and biofuels for transport-may have a much wider potential role to play. The extent to which this potential is fulfilled will be further determined by resources availability, and market segment constraints, as well as policy measures to improve deployment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

MARKAL is a well-known optimization model of the energy-economy system; CIMS is a policy simulation model developed initially for Canada. The models require the same technology and financial data, but CIMS, which does not assume financial cost minimization, also requires information on technology preferences, risk perceptions, tax effects and other critical factors in the decision making of firms and households in order to simulate their likely response to policies. Given the market inertia that is incorporated in a CIMS simulation, it estimates higher costs of emission reduction than MARKAL. CIMS' present value cost estimate for Canada to achieve its Kyoto target of 6% below 1990 emissions by 2010 is $45 billion (CDN) while MARKAL's is $15 billion. When linked to a macro-economic model, the GDP impact of CIMS is 3% while that of MARKAL is less than 1%. This difference would have been slightly larger had all target assumptions of the two models been identical. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bottom-up long-term planning models generally consider low levels of spatial, temporal, and technical details to reduce associated computation. However, these details are required to capture spatial and temporal variability of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and perform harmonized dispatch of conventional generating units. In their absence, models may overestimate RESs uptake and underestimate the quantum of required flexible resources. This may create a false impression of sector decarbonization and the obtained capacity mix may result in frequent RES or load curtailment during real-time system operations. In this context, this study aims to improve upon the shortcomings of conventional planning approaches and develop a TIMES based planning model for the Indian power sector. The model adopts high spatial and temporal definitions of 5 regions and 288 sub-annual timeslices. RESs are categorized into sub-classes based on annual capacity factors to capture their intra-regional variations without further increasing the spatial resolution. Each month is represented by a day of chronological hourly resolution that facilitates the capture of RES temporal variations and incorporation of operational aspects of generating units such as minimum stable generation, ramp limits and partial load operation. The impact of these operational parameters on system planning is analysed to identify a trade-off between planning accuracy and computational complexity. The study is relevant for countries that are rigorously following their decarbonization plans with high penetration of variable RESs and have a similar trajectory as that of India. The results indicate that decarbonization levels can be better assessed if capacity mix and flexible resources are adequately valued by considering operational parameters at the planning stage for a power system dominated by low flexible generation.},

abstract = {The need for technological transition of electricity production becomes a global problem. However, in coal-dominated Polish power system this need is even more crucial than anywhere, since technical lifetime of the most domestic power plants is ending. In this paper, the impact of the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) for CO2 combined with sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission trading mechanism on power technology choice was studied using Market Allocation (MARKAL) model of Polish power system. Poland can contribute to achieving ambitious EU CO2 emission reduction goals to 2050 by switching to diversified electricity mix of low-carbon coal technologies with CCS, and carbon-free options e.g. nuclear, biomass IGCC, wind onshore and offshore. This ‘low-carbon' mix can be achieved only at high emission allowance prices, stimulated by the introduction of Market Stability Reserve to EU ETS and successive decrease in EU CO2 emission cap. At high emission allowance prices, Poland's CO2 emissions from ETS-participating electricity generating plants are expected to decrease in 2010–2050 period by 96–99%, depending on the projected electricity consumption. Model results prove that SO2/NOx emission trading scheme, envisaged in Poland, is not effective, in view of Industrial Emission Directive implementation, and should be reconsidered.},

The research described here was devised to represent this potential, and thereby explore the possible role of marine energy in future energy systems. The paper describes a scenario for the accelerated development of marine energy technology, and the incorporation of this scenario into wider scenarios of UK energy system decarbonisation from now to 2050. The scenarios suggest that the accelerated development of marine energy could contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of energy supply in the UK, especially over the medium to long term. However, this is predicated on sustained innovation, learning and cost reduction over time. Encouragingly, a number of recently established policy support programmes are now beginning to stimulate the development of marine energy in Scotland, the UK and beyond. As the paper discusses, building on these initiatives, and 'realising' the accelerated development of marine energy, present a number of challenges, and will increasingly require international efforts.

The goal of this study is the identification of the viable technology and legal options for CO2 mitigation, and the impact assessment of the options for the Korean power generation sector. The MARKAL modeling package of IEA/ETSAP was used as an appropriate tool to make the database of Korean energy system in the model and assess the effects of the options. Several scenarios were made to study the effect of CO2 emission reductions on the Korean power generation sector, and these were classified as the Base Scenario, New Technology Scenario, Carbon Tax Scenario, Total Carbon Emission Cap Scenario, and mixtures of the scenarios. Under the base scenario based on the National Electricity Plan of Korea, the future power generation will be dominated by nuclear and coal power plants, with some of natural gas fired plant and a very small proportion of renewables. However, with increasing pressure to mitigate CO2 emissions, the analysis results of all four scenarios and combination of the scenarios showed that Korea would have to adopt a little different approach. An extensive modeling work was, therefore, undertaken to analyze the impact of various measures on introduction of new technologies and policies in order to achieve significant CO2 emissions reduction. As results of this work, we found estimated average cost for a ton carbon mitigation and estimated amount of CO2 emission reduction by application of each scenario including constraint of lower limit of coal power generation for security of energy supplies in Korea. The results obtained are to be suggested as recommendation in establishing a sustainable energy portfolio within the Korean power generation sector. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III report emphasized that climate policies can deliver energy security as a co-benefit, in large part through reducing energy imports. Using five state-of-the-art global energy-economy models and eight long-term scenarios, we show that although deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions would reduce energy imports, the reverse is not true: ambitious policies constraining energy imports would have an insignificant impact on climate change. Restricting imports of all fuels would lower twenty-first-century emissions by only 2-15% against the Baseline scenario as compared with a 70% reduction in a 450 stabilization scenario. Restricting only oil imports would have virtually no impact on emissions. The modelled energy independence targets could be achieved at policy costs comparable to those of existing climate pledges but a fraction of the cost of limiting global warming to 2 °C.},

However, there is still great uncertainty surrounding the size of this potential market and therefore its impact on the global gas trade. In order to identify some of the important factors that might drive natural gas consumption in key demand areas in China, we focus on three regions: Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai. Using the economic optimization model MARKAL, we initially assume that the drivers are government mandates of emissions standards, reform of the Chinese financial structure, the price and available supply of natural gas, and the rate of penetration of advanced power generating and end-use. The results from the model show that the level of natural gas consumption is most sensitive to policy scenarios, which strictly limit SO2 emissions from power plants. The model also revealed that the low cost of capital for power plants in China boosts the economic viability of capital-intensive coal-fired plants. This suggests that reform within the financial sector could be a lever for encouraging increased natural gas use. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Seven General Equilibrium (CGE) and energy system models on either the global or national scale are soft-linked and harmonized with respect to population and economic assumptions. We simulate a climate regime, based on long-term convergence of per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, starting from the emission pledges presented in the Copenhagen Accord to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and allowing full emissions trading between countries. Under the climate regime, Indian emission allowances are allowed to grow more than the Chinese allowances, due to the per capita convergence rule and the higher population growth in India. Economic and energy implications not only differ among the two countries, but also across model types. Decreased energy intensity is the most important abatement approach in the CGE models, while decreased carbon intensity is most important in the energy system models. The reduction in carbon intensity is mostly achieved through deployment of carbon capture and storage, renewable energy sources and nuclear energy. The economic impacts are generally higher in China than in India, due to higher 2010–2050 cumulative abatement in China and the fact that India can offset more of its abatement cost though international emission trading.},

abstract = {Coal-condensing power is marginal production in the deregulated Nordic power market and an increase in electricity consumption will therefore result in increased CO2 emissions. One goal of the Swedish energy policy is to reduce the amount of electricity used for heating in the building sector. This paper investigates the potential for reduction in electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating, taking the energy infrastructure into account, here defined as the capital stock of the buildings and heating systems together with geographical variations in heat intensity. In order to include the energy infrastructure in the analysis the study is made on a regional level (Southern Sweden) applying a comprehensive database describing the energy infrastructure of the region. The paper compares two scenarios for converting the heating systems of the region: one employing energy savings and with the aim to phase out the oil and most of the electricity used for heating purposes and a second which illustrates the effect if the current trend in the heating market continues. Both scenarios apply commercially available technologies only. From the second scenario it is seen that the current trend-contrary to the aim of the Swedish Governmental policy-shows an increase in electricity dependency for heating, mainly due to a large diffusion of heat pumps, but also due to installations of electrical floor heating and electricity heating systems installed in newly constructed one- and two-dwelling buildings. However, the options proposed in first scenario show that it is possible to reach significant reductions in the electricity dependency due to heating and in corresponding CO2 emissions. An analysis of the age structure of the heating systems shows that the transformation of the heating system is not completed until the year 2025, if new investments for replacement of heating systems are made only provided they have reached their economical life time, and only applying heating technologies which at present are known to be economically competitive. It can be concluded that future policies on transforming the energy system should be based on an analysis that takes the entire energy infrastructure (in this case of heating system) into account (e.g. not directed towards single technologies). More specifically for the region studied, which is considered representative for Sweden as a whole, policies should aim at installing heat pumps to replace electricity heating only in regions with low heat density where district heating is not competitive, in contrary to the present situation where heat pumps replace all types of heating systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The LCS modeling is soft-linked to global targets through regional emission constraints derived from the global stabilization targets. The disaggregated, yet soft-linked, assessments provide opportunities to articulate scenarios that include context-specific inputs, and thereby explicitly consider benefits and deliver more realistic and implementable roadmaps. We find that LCS modeling exercises are still at a relatively early stage in terms of modeling space, and need methodological enhancements. However, this approach offers considerable promise in a world where major emerging economies are undergoing rapid transformation, national and regional interests everywhere still precede global interests, and implementation of the carbon market remains fragmentary.

abstract = {The International Energy Agency Energy Technologies Perspectives (ETP) model is used for the assessment of the prospects for carbon abatement options, including carbon capture and storage, up to 2050. Three main scenarios are considered: a baseline scenario with current energy policies, an accelerated technology scenario (ACT) with an associated CO2 reduction incentive development, and a scenario in which global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 50% compared to current levels in 2050 (BLUE). The analysis suggests that CCS can account for up to 19% of all CO2 reduction in 2050, which would equal 10.4 Gt CO2 capture and storage. The power sector would account for 54% of all CCS, the remainder is in manufacturing industry and the fuel transformation sector. CCS is a critical option. Without CCS, the cost to meet the same target would rise by 71%. The potential rate at which CCS can be introduced exceeds the rate at which regular capital stock is typically replaced, if plants are retrofitted or closed down before the end of their technical life span. Retrofitting of coal plants with CCS plays a very significant role in the ACT Map scenario. But at the price of USD 200/t CO2 envisaged in the BLUE scenario, there is sufficient economic incentive to accelerate the replacement of inefficient power plants with new plants equipped with CCS before the existing plants reach the end of their life span. In the BLUE scenario, 350 GW of coal-fired power-plant capacity is closed down early. The remaining 700 GW consists of 80% new capacity that is equipped with CCS, and 20% retrofits with CCS. Following IEA recommendations, the G8 countries have announced that they will commit 20 demonstration plants for CCS by 2010. Also the G8, China India and Korea have asked the IEA to continue its work on roadmaps and transition paths for CCS in power generation and in industry, in cooperation with other bodies such as CSLF.

Compared with base case scenario, implementation of various energy scenarios could prevent 608-5144 and 1189-10,462 PM10-related avoidable deaths (mid-value) in 2010 and 2020, respectively; and it could also decrease substantial cases of relevant diseases. These findings illustrate that an effective energy and environmental policy will play an active role in reduction of air pollutant emissions, improvement of air quality, and public health. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The UK government sets a legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 80% by 2050, while ensuring a secure and affordable energy supply. Under the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) Energy 2050 project, four core scenario analyses have been undertaken to explore the pathways to a low carbon and resilient energy system. A resilience energy system is defined as the set of technologies, physical infrastructure, institutions, policies and practices located in and associated with the UK which enable energy services to be delivered to UK consumers. A number of models and analytical tools have been used for the resilient energy system analyses, and MARKAL model is one amongst them. Within the analytical framework of the UK MARKAL elastic demand (MED) model, the resilient energy system has been characterised though diversity in energy supply and reducing the final energy demand. A set of user-defined constraints have been chosen to model the resilient scenario in MED. The MED analyses try to seek answers to: Will investing in a resistant energy system make it easier or more difficult to reduce CO2 emissions? What is the additional cost of investing in resilient energy system compared to a low carbon energy system? The analyses show that a resilient energy system reduces CO2 emissions, but does not go far enough to stay on the pathway to the 2050 80% reduction target. This paper presents the type of constraints used in the MED analyses and key insights from the parametric analyses.},

This paper reports on a methodology for temporal disaggregation in the widely applied energy service driven, technology rich, cost optimizing, linear programming MARKAL energy system model. A flexible time slicing feature is developed to enhance representation of diurnal and seasonal electricity demand curves through disaggregation of resource availability and energy service demands. In a first application of a temporal UK MARKAL model, a range of runs investigate the role of electricity storage at supply and demand sides. The results display considerably enhanced insights, notably on the role and preference of demand-side electricity storage over supply-side storage. On average, the system chooses about 7-10% of electricity demand as storage. On the supply side, hydrogen-based electricity storage is greatly preferred but stored-hydrogen is used in the transport sector rather than for power system balancing mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The 2050 Swiss energy strategy envisages 30–75% introduction of electric cars by 2050, which is designed to support the goal of decarbonising the energy sector. While the Swiss government has decided to phase out nuclear electricity, deployment of electric cars can affect electricity supply and emission trajectories. Therefore, potential interactions between the electricity and transport sectors must be considered in assessing the future role of electric mobility. We analyse a set of scenarios using the Swiss TIMES energy system model with high temporal resolution. We generate insights into cross-sectoral trade-offs between electricity supply and electrification/decarbonisation of car fleets. E-mobility supports decarbonisation of car fleet even if electricity is supplied from large gas power plants or relatively low cost sources of imported electricity. However, domestic renewable based electricity generation is expected to be too limited to support e-mobility. Stringent abatement targets without centralised gas power plants render e-mobility less attractive, with natural gas hybrids becoming cost effective. Thus the cost effectiveness of electric mobility depends on policy decisions in the electricity sector. The substitution of fossil fuels with electricity in transport has the potential to reduce revenues from fuel taxation. Therefore it is necessary to ensure consistency between electricity sector and transport energy policies.},

Scenario and modelling assessment of this stringent target consistently finds that all sectors need to contribute to emissions reductions. The UK residential sector accounts for around 30% of the total final energy use and more than one-quarter of CO2 emissions. This paper focuses on modelling of the residential sector in a system wide energy-economy models (UK MARKAL) and key UK sectoral housing stock models. The UK residential energy demand and CO2 emission from the both approaches are compared. In an energy system with 60% economy-wide CO2 reductions, the residential sector plays a commensurate role. Energy systems analysis finds this reduction is primarily driven by energy systems interactions notably decarbonisation of the power sector combined with increased appliance efficiency. The stock models find alternate decarbonisation pathways based on assumptions related to the future building stock and behavioural changes. The paper concludes with a discussion on the assumptions and drivers of emission reductions in different models of the residential energy sector. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the incremental insights from this hourly model, it is compared to an aggregated model with only two diurnal timeslices like in most MARKAL/TIMES models. Two scenarios have been analysed with both models to answer the following questions: Are there differences in model solutions? What are the benefits of having a high number of timeslices? Are there any computational limitations? The primary objective of this paper is to understand the differences between the solutions of the two models, rather than Swiss policy implication or potential uncertainties in input parameters and assumptions. The analysis reveals that the hourly model offers powerful insights into the electricity generation schedule. Nevertheless, the TIMES framework cannot substitute for a dispatch model because some features cannot be represented; however, the long model time horizon and integrated system approaches of TIMES provide features not available in conventional dispatch models.

abstract = {The Swiss electricity system is dominated by low-carbon hydro and nuclear generation. The Government's decision to phase-out nuclear energy exacerbates Switzerland's climate change mitigation goals. Response to this challenge requires systemic changes to the energy system, which is generally a long-term, uncertain and systemic process, affected by technology choices across the entire energy system. A comprehensive Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM) with high temporal detail has been developed for the analysis of plausible low-carbon energy pathways focusing on uncertainties related to policy (climate change mitigation and acceptability of new centralised electricity generation) and international fuel prices. Increasing electrification of end-uses is seen across the scenarios, resulting in continuous growth in electricity demands. The electrification of heating and e-mobility substitute direct use of fossil fuels in end-use sectors and contribute to a significant carbon dioxide emission (CO2) reduction. Centralised gas power plants and renewables become key source of electricity supply. Given the phaseout of nuclear generation, clear policy signals are required to ensure capacity is built to achieve a low-carbon energy system. At the same time, it is also essential to ensure consistency between the electricity sector and end-use energy policies. For the long-term carbon reduction target, some non-cost-effective conservation measures are important early in the period because they are available only at the time of building renovation.},

abstract = {About one-third of the Swiss nuclear capacity is due to be retired in the next ten years, creating a short-term supply gap. In addition, the Swiss Federal Council has decided to phase out nuclear power over the longer term by not replacing existing nuclear power plants after retirement. We have analysed possible electricity supply options for responding to these two developments under different conditions using the Swiss TIMES electricity sector model-a least-cost optimization framework. Short-term demand can be cost-effectively met with new investment in gas-fired generation capacity. However, meeting the government's CO 2 emission and renewable electricity targets requires an accelerated investment in renewable generation and/or increased reliance on imported electricity. In the medium and longer term, nuclear represents the most cost-effective option. The alternatives to nuclear lead to increased dependence on imported natural gas, seasonal renewables and imported electricity. All non-nuclear supply options increase the cost of electricity supply by between 50 and 150%, and create a range of tradeoffs between supply security and climate change mitigation goal. However, it is expected that an accelerated uptake of end-use efficiency measures and demand side management would reduce future electricity demand, thus reducing the need for some expensive supply options. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Fusarium head blight (FHB, scab), caused by Fusarium graminearum or F. culmorum, results in yield and quality reductions and accumulation of mycotoxins. Two inoculation methods are commonly used. Spraying a spore suspension on the head (spray inoculation) will detect resistance to initial infection (type I) and to disease spread within the spike (type II). Injecting a spore suspension into individual florets (point inoculation) will detect type II resistance only. To analyze the association of spray and point inoculation, 20 elite winter wheat cultivars from Romania, Germany, and Switzerland were inoculated in factorial field experiments in seven environments (location x year combinations) in Germany and Romania. Response to FHB was assessed by the percentage of visually infected spikelets and head weight relative to the noninoculated control. Point and spray inoculations resulted in a mean disease severity varying from 52 to 63%. Significant (P = 0.01) genotypic variation was found within and across the environments. Genotype-environment interaction was important also. Estimates of entry-mean heritability were higher for spray than for point inoculation as assessed by percent infected spikelets (0.81 versus 0.77) and relative head weight (0.77 versus 0.52). Significant (P = 0.01) interaction was found between inoculation methods. Consequently, coefficients of phenotypic correlation between both methods were low to medium for percent infected spikelets (0.40, P > 0.1) and relative head weight (0.52, P = 0.05). We conclude that the application of both inoculation methods should provide additional information for selection and scientific studies. Spray inoculation, however, is less laborious for large-scale routine screening of breeding materials.},

abstract = {Purpose: This article is based on the REACCESS research project, sponsored by the European Commission, with the objectives of evaluating the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of present and future energy corridors between the European countries (EU27) and their main energy suppliers. GCC countries have an important role to play given their role in EU energy supply and in greenhouse gas emissions. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A single energy model was built by hard-linking the TIMES integrated assessment model (TIAM-World), the Pan European TIMES model (PET), and the RECOR model (REaccess CORridors), including more than 1,000 possible energy corridors supplying the European countries. Another major methodology advance was to create a hybrid objective function, combining the usual cost objective and a metric representing the supply risk incurred by EU27. The risk component was constructed via a novel approach that aggregates the elemental risk parameters of each corridor using a Min-Max function. Four contrasted scenarios were assessed, based on security and climate objectives. Findings: Among the many results, it appears that a large reduction of the supply risk may be achieved at a very modest increase of the total energy system cost for EU27. Cross-effects of climate mitigation and security objectives are also observed. Due to the diversification requirement, the contribution of GCC countries to EU energy imports increases under risk scenario. Sensitivity analyses show that the European energy system seems unable to reduce the market shares of fossil fuels import from MENA countries, including GCC countries, much below the reference case, proving the strong dependency of EU27 energy system from these countries. However, total fossil fuels imports, as well as total energy consumed, are decreased under the risk adverse scenarios. Originality/value: Methodological developments, as described above, result in an advanced tool to assess how to increase the "energy system security", by reducing the concentration of supply countries, diversifying import sources but also reducing the energy dependence at the end-use side. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Following a multi-scenario framework based on the technology assumptions proposed by the 27th Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-27), our analysis focuses on analyzing the impacts of key technology assumptions on climate policies, including the interdependencies of different technological options. Each scenario may be considered as either a possible state of nature upon which one has no influence, each scenario thus dictating the availability (or non availability) of some subset of the technology groups, or as an opportunity for society, by its own actions and policies, to influence the availability of said technology group. The main insights obtained from the assessment show the prominent role of bioenergy as a means to abate greenhouse gas emissions, irrespective of other technological developments, while the role of the other technologies (wind and solar, carbon capture and sequestration, nuclear) are more dependent of one another. It appears that CCS may play a sort of "backstop" role: it compensates for a lower contribution of solar and wind, or of nuclear. This means that an increased social acceptability of one (or all) of these three sets of technology should be at the heart of future climate policies. The costs caused by the adaptation of electricity networks to accommodate a high fraction of intermittent sources would deserve more attention in future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Each of these new features is illustrated by results taken from large-scale extended MARKAL models of Quebec and Ontario.
