abstract = {Urban energy system modelling allows megacities to assess their future development and to draw sustainable pathways to meet the rapidly increasing energy needs. This paper elaborates three different scenarios for energy transition in Greater Cairo with particular emphasis on the impact of lowering the share of inhabitants living in informal settlements. A city-specific TIMES energy system model is used to investigate how energy supply and demand will evolve between 2015 and 2050. Besides, the impacts in final energy consumption and CO2 emissions are investigated considering different socio-economic pathways. The scenarios show that the long-term cost-efficiency optimization leads to the decarbonization of the power sector even in the absence of climate constraints. Climate policies are modeled to achieve by 2050 a carbon emissions reduction of 50% below the 2015 baseline. The results indicate that the implementation of current urban plans will double the carbon emissions per capita if no mitigation policies are adopted. The urban expansion programs need to take into consideration the energy-environment-economic nexus and to be coupled with climate mitigation policies to contain the rising carbon emissions.},

abstract = {In Indonesia, energy consumption (excluding non-commercial energy) increased from 328 MBOE in 1990 to 478 MBOE in 1995. As a consequence, energy sector CO2 emissions increased from 150 million tons to over 200 million tons during the same period. The present rapid economic growth Indonesia is experiencing (7-8%) will continue in the future. Based on a BAU scenario, primary energy supply for the year 2020 will be 18,551 PJ, an increase of 5.9% annually from 1990 CO2 from the energy system will increase from 150 Teragrams in 1990 to 1264 Teragram in 2020. The mitigation scenario would reduce total CO2 emissions from the BAU scenario by 10% for the year 2000 and 20% by 2020. Some demand side management and energy conservation programs are already included in the BAU scenario. In the mitigation scenario, these programs are expanded, leading to lower final energy demand in the industrial and residential sectors. Indonesia's total primary energy supply in 2020 is approximately 5% lower for the mitigation scenario than for the BAU scenario. In the BAU scenario, coal and oil have the same contribution (25%). In the mitigation scenario, natural gas and nonfossil fuels such as hydropower, geothermal, and nuclear have higher contributions. {\textcopyright} 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The analyses are based on a long-term energy system model of Bangladesh using the MARKAL framework. The analysis shows that Bangladesh will not be able to meet the future energy demand without importing energy. However, alternative policies on CO2 emission constraints reduce the burden of imported fuel, improve energy security and reduce environmental impacts. The results show that the introduction of the CO2 emission reduction targets and carbon taxes directly affect the shift of technologies from high carbon content fossil-based to low carbon content fossil-based and clean renewable energy-based technologies compared to the base scenario. With the cumulative CO2 emission reduction target of 10-20% and carbon tax of 2500Taka/ton, the cumulative net energy imports during 2005-2035 would be reduced in the range of 39-65% and 37%, respectively, compared to the base scenario emission level. The total primary energy requirement would be reduced in the range of 4.5-22.3% in the CO2 emission reduction targets and carbon tax 2500Taka/ton scenarios and the primary energy supply system would be diversified compared to the base scenario. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Defining a roadmap to achieving low carbon targets and explaining these targets in quantitative form as much as possible is known as backcasting. Plenty of computer-based quantitative models and tools are used to outline low carbon society scenarios in the Asia-Pacific region and implementations of such models are underway. This paper spotlights these quantitative models and tools which are used to achieve backcasting benchmarks. These models are critically reviewed for their functioning and real possibilities on ground levels and suggestions have been made to improve practical implementation in developing Asia. The study found that all these models are highly acceptable and applicable in Asian countries but actual applications are rare, with Japan as the leading country in implementing such applications, followed by Malaysia. Estimation of CO 2 sinks, open availability, and energy service demands (built-in option) are major weaknesses of the models. We also concluded that these computer-based quantitative models are helpful for almost all of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region facing such issues as data limitation, fewer resources, and lack of government participation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Long-term energy planning models and dispatch simulations are two key stages in the methodology for a cost-effective transition to a low-carbon power system. Although these stages are equally important, they are often performed independently. This decoupled approach can lead to future investment trajectories decided by long-term energy planning models with no guarantee of a reliable electricity supply. To tackle this problem, the aim of this study was to develop a general methodological framework using a multi-model approach to address adequacy requirements in the long term. An automated soft-linking model was used to successively: i. Plan the optimal power generation mix to satisfy a given level of future expected electricity demand subject to various constraints using the TIMES framework (The Integrated MARKAL–EFOM System). ii. Assess the adequacy of the obtained power generation mix under several climatic and operational future states using the probabilistic operational open-source model ANTARES (A New Tool for the generation Adequacy Reporting of Electric Systems). iii. Implement iterative feedback loops based on the estimated ability of different generating technologies to support peak demand (capacity credit) to ensure a total firm capacity in line with the electricity supply criterion.This methodology was applied to a case study of power generation planning in France for the period 2013–2050. The results show that using TIMES alone provides a power generation mix for 2030 that risks insufficient supply levels. On the other hand, activating iterative feedback loops over capacity-credit exogenous parameters has the potential to ensure both the economic effectiveness of the mix and the security of the electricity supply criterion set by the French public authorities.},

Since interconnection with neighbouring Spain may be one of the key drivers to achieve a cost-effective low carbon pathway, combined with new generating technologies, we evaluate its importance by modelling the Portuguese system either as an isolated or as part of an integrated Iberian system. To design the low carbon roadmap for 2050 in Portugal, TIMES - The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM (MARKet ALlocation-Energy Flow Optimisation Model) System was used. It is an optimization partial equilibrium bottom-up model generator that finds the minimal cost solution for an energy system over a certain time period. Our approach accounts for the short term dynamics of supply and demand to enable a better match and optimize resources complementarities. The results show that modelling Portugal as an isolated system can lead to underinvestment and underuse of the country's endowment of renewable energy sources in the longer term, which reduces the efficiency of investment. The modelling of Portugal as an interconnected energy system can therefore have a significant impact on the design of a sustainable electricity system and lead to improved investment efficiency with lower costs risk. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Its main goal (as a first step) is to show the relevance of using a highly detailed spatial and temporal modeling tool of the Portuguese electricity system in order to be able to adequately capture climate variability in the planning of the system up to 2050. To do so, we consider seasonal and intraday hydro, wind and solar resources variability in a large TIMES energy system model, in the eTIMES_PT model. Existing hydro, wind and thermal powerplants are modelled individually, whereas new plants are modelled at municipality level. The importance of introducing climate variability is assessed by modeling six scenarios: a reference case and both “humid” and “dry” hydropower scenarios. Each of these is also modelled with CO2 emissions cap by 2050. Results show that hydropower electricity generation variations are within range of those referred in literature by other authors. However, in this work, we are able to capture higher variations within seasons and time of day. Also, the analysis enables to account for the combined variability of hydro, PV and wind resources. This variability will subsequently consider data from seasonal forecasts and climate projections.},

abstract = {Despite an emerging consensus that societal energy consumption and related emissions are not only influenced by technical efficiency but also by lifestyles and socio-cultural factors, few attempts have been made to operationalise these insights in models of energy demand. This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use, the environment and well-being. The 'what if' Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case. Despite the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles and the larger share of electricity in final energy demand, it shows a future where electricity decarbonisation could be delayed. The paper illustrates the key trade-off between the more aggressive pursuit of purely technological fixes and demand reduction in the transport sector and concludes there are strong arguments for pursuing both demand and supply side solutions in the pursuit of emissions reduction and energy security. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Both of these scenarios are modelled with and without climate policy by restricting cumulative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The analysis focusses on implications on China's primary energy production and consumption, primary energy trade, generation mix and final energy consumptions. Estimates of global recoverable gas resources have increased sharply in the recent decade, predominantly as a result of technological advances unlocking gas resources in unconventional reservoirs, such as tight sands, coal bed methane, and, most importantly, shale rock. Although at present, unconventional gas predominantly plays a significant role only in United States, it has the potential to reduce supply, price volatility, and energy security concerns for a number of regions globally, as lessons learned in the United States are applied internationally.},

abstract = {Both fuel cell and electric vehicles have the potential to play a major role in a transformation towards a low carbon transport system that meets travel demands in a cleaner and more efficient way if hydrogen and electricity was produced in a sustainable manner. Cost reductions are central to this challenge, since these technologies are currently too expensive to compete with conventional vehicles based on fossil fuels. One important mechanism through which technology costs fall is learning-by-doing, the process by which cumulative global deployment leads to cost reduction. This paper develops long-term scenarios by implementing global technology learning endogenously in the TIAM-UCL global energy system model to analyse the role of hydrogen and electricity to decarbonise the transport sector. The analysis uses a multi-cluster global technology learning approach where key components (fuel cell, electric battery and electric drive train), to which learning is applied, are shared across different vehicle technologies such as hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and battery operated vehicles in cars, light goods vehicles and buses. The analysis shows that hydrogen and electricity can play a critical role to decarbonise the transport sector. They emerge as complementary transport fuels, rather than as strict competitors, in the short and medium term, with both deployed as fuels in all scenarios. However, in the very long-term when the transport sector has been almost completely decarbonised, technology competition between hydrogen and electricity does arise, in the sense that scenarios using more hydrogen in the transport sector use less electricity and vice versa.},

A second key UK energy policy is to increase the share of final energy consumption from renewables sources to 15% by 2020, as part of the wider EU Renewable Directive. The UK's principle mechanisms to meet this renewable target are the Renewable Obligation (RO) in the electricity sector, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), and most recently the Renewable Heat Programme (RHP) for buildings. This study quantifies a range of policies, energy pathways, and sectoral trade-offs when combining mid- and long-term UK renewables and CO2 reduction policies. Stringent renewable policies are the binding constraints through 2020. Furthermore, the interactions between RO, RTFO, and RHP policies drive trade-offs between low carbon electricity, bio-fuels, high efficiency natural gas, and demand reductions as well as resulting 2020 welfare costs.

abstract = {The EU's Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) sets a binding target for energy-savings in EU member states. The EED further requires member states to perform ex-ante evaluations of energy efficiency policies implemented to achieve these savings. However, ex-ante evaluation of energy efficiency policies is difficult as it requires detailed modelling of end-users' investment and energy demand behaviour. This paper details the Danish IntERACT modelling approach for ex-ante evaluation of energy efficiency policies directed at residential heating. IntERACT integrates the energy system model TIMES-DK into a computable general equilibrium framework. The paper explores the potential for meeting Denmark's EED-target through a policy-induced increase in households' investments in energy efficiency retrofits. The paper considers the effect of energy efficiency policies on households' investment behaviour by applying different levels of hurdle rates on households' investments in energy efficiency retrofits. The paper shows that reducing the hurdle rate from 25% to 4% could meet more than a third of Danish energy-saving requirements for the period 2021–2030. This result includes a direct rebound effect of 31%. Finally, the paper demonstrates that reducing the hurdle below 10% has a substantial negative impact on households' disposable income, making such policy less viable from a policy perspective.},

abstract = {Limiting the rise in global temperatures requires the rapid, and massive deployment of solutions to reduce carbon emissions at all levels. The development of intermittent renewable energy resources has received significant support from governments, and its production will considerably increase. The introduction of this high electrical production presents some challenges, in particular, the allocation of high production in low consumption periods. One of the most promoted solutions to cope with this challenge is the integration of power-to-gas technologies (P2G). In this area, the European Union and some of its members have presented plans supporting the production and consumption of hydrogen. At the same time, it should be noted that the development strategies for these technologies are largely deployed at the local level. To allow local territories to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy system, national governments are extending the application of their energy policy to local areas. This is the case in France, which over the last decades has adopted laws to extend the application of its energy policy at local level, with the objective of ensuring better, faster deployment of its energy transition and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. As a result, the French regions have targeted objectives for the development of their local energy resources. The SUD Provence-Alpes-C{\^{o}}te d'Azur Region (PACA) in southern France, in response to these air, energy, environment, and climate change adaptation responsibilities, has set a target to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This will involve the massive development of solar photovoltaic production as the region has considerable access to solar resources. The region has also presented a hydrogen plan to support the development of this energy in the region and contribute to national efforts. This study, conducted with TIMESPACA a bottom-up optimization model representing the energy system of the PACA region, analyzes how P2G technologies contribute to the development of solar resources. Results show that P2G technologies are essential for the decarbonization of the regional energy system and the deployment of renewables, that they are required to reach national and global decarbonization objectives, and that they are expected to structure the whole hydrogen chain.},

abstract = {This article presents the long-term techno-economic prospective model ETEM-AR that aims to help decision-makers to analyze the future of the energy mix and energy use at a regional level in the context of climate change. The model incorporates a description of the two potential paths one may choose to follow when confronting the impacts of climate change: mitigation and adaptation, together with the corresponding technologies. The inherent uncertainties in the evaluation of the importance of climate change and of its consequences on the energy sector are treated via stochastic programming and robust optimization. A set of contrasted scenarios is used to describe the possible future consequences of climate change on key parameters of the energy system, such as the reduction of the efficiency of some of the technologies. By comparing the results emerging from the stochastic analysis performed with these scenarios with the analysis of deterministic scenarios, one can understand the necessity, or the absence of it, of investing in certain adaptation technologies prior to the unfolding of the considered uncertainties. The robust optimization techniques are used to ensure the optimal strategy remains a good strategy if some parameters vary in a given interval. The main effect of using a robust analysis is the emergence of a diversification of the technology choices. The model, ETEM-AR, is illustrated here through its application to the French region of Midi-Pyr{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}es.},

The approach is designed to simultaneously address the shortcomings and maintain the attractive features of detailed energy sector and general equilibrium models. It also reflects common country-level energy planning processes. We illustrate the capabilities of this integrated bottom-up approach by analyzing the implications of (i) a carbon tax, (ii) liberalization of import supply restrictions in order to exploit regional hydropower potential, and (iii) a combined policy where both carbon taxes and import liberalization are pursued. For the combined scenario, our results suggest substantial emissions reductions relative to Baseline at essentially no cost to economic growth but about a one percent reduction in employment. We conclude that a regional energy strategy, anchored in hydropower, represents a potentially inexpensive approach to decarbonizing the South African economy. The strategy also has political economy attractions in that the combined approach reduces the burden of adjustment of politically sensitive sectors.},

abstract = {Higher spatial resolution is becoming a key component of energy system analysis. Existing multi-regional national scale energy systems optimisation models (ESOMs) facilitate an improved understanding of spatial dynamics. Yet, region-specific characteristics of transport technologies and infrastructures along with consumer heterogeneity have remained under-investigated. The current paper addresses this gap by developing a multi-regional transport sector within the system-wide TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM). The transport sector is divided into 26 sub-regions, and each region is characterised by the existing vehicle fleet, public transport availability, scrappage rate, annual mileage, vehicle fuel economy and the corresponding passenger and freight mobility demand. The consumers (car buyers) are disaggregated based on their income level to incorporate a more realistic representation of their behaviour in vehicle purchasing decisions. While TIM ensures carbon neutrality across the whole energy system by mid-century, this study mainly explores the decarbonisation of passenger Light-Duty Vehicles (LDVs). It shows to what extent different measures (i.e, LDV improvements, monetary incentives, modal shift, biofuel obligation, carbon tax and occupancy rate) can contribute to meeting ambitious mitigation targets by 2030. Spatially resolved analysis as the main novelty of this research presents valuable insights into regional electric vehicles (EVs) diffusion and their electricity consumption. The proposed method can be used to address the uncertainty that arises from consumer heterogeneity in the policymaking process. The findings also suggest keeping financial EV incentives until the mid-2020s to meet the ambitious goals. Finally, decarbonisation without demand-side strategies (i.e., controlling the level of private-car-based mobility) seems to be unachievable.},

When analyzing national policies, the findings of worldwide analyses are of limited accuracy and the large aggregates on which they are built level out most local specificities and inertia. Specific assessments are hence needed. This paper quantifies the dynamic evolution of carbon values for French climate and energy policy. Its time dependency over successive periods and the effects of setting intermediate targets are evaluated using a long-term optimization model. Addressing critical issues for France, we produce consistent energy, emissions and carbon value estimates with a 5-year time step. Our results are situated above the upper range of carbon value estimates of world models with an overlapping zone. We show that the official policy guideline value is only consistent with an optimistic combination of assumptions. The central estimates are 4 times greater than the guideline carbon value for 2050 and up to 14 times greater in 2020 because of short-term inertia that are costly to move. We also find that with intermediate objectives, the carbon value's dynamic is more than a simple upward curve and that its variability is itself time dependent. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The transition to low carbon societies may increase peak electricity demand, which can be costly to supply with renewable energy, whose availability is uncertain. Buildings are often the main cause of peak demand, and they are believed to hold a large unrealised energy-efficiency potential. If realised, this potential could considerably mitigate the transition costs to low carbon societies, reducing average and peak electricity demands. We explore this potential in several cost-optimal global warming (GW) mitigation scenarios using a multi-sector TIMES energy system model of the province of Quebec for the period 2011–2050. Heating and conservation measures in the residential sector are modelled using building simulations and parameters' values from the literature. The intra-annual availability of renewable energy and electricity imports is derived from time-series analysis. Additionally, the influence of key parameters such as the projections of primary energy demand and emissions from reservoir impoundment is evaluated. Finally, we discuss some of the barriers that could hamper the energy transition and how they can be overcome. Results indicate that peak demand would rise by 30% due to GW mitigation efforts, but it can be effectively reduced by interventions in the residential sector. Heat pumps are the most cost effective heating technology, despite their lower efficiencies in cold climates. Better-insulated building envelopes have an important role in new houses, reducing by 14% the GW mitigation costs and suggesting that building codes should be more ambitious. The scenario considering denser urban developments has much lower GW mitigation costs, underscoring the importance of urban planning and potential changes in demand. The observed uptakes are contingent to the pricing of energy services being based on marginal costs and cost-optimising behaviour, and are less likely to take place with current market barriers. Finally, the emissions from reservoir creation alter the merit-order of electricity supply, favouring run-of-river power plants and suggesting that these emissions should be considered in GW mitigation scenarios.},

The use of a cutoff criterion reduces exponentially the number of connection points between models, facilitating the analysis of scenarios with a large number of technologies involved. The method is used to assess the potential effects of deploying low-carbon technologies to reduce combustion emissions in the province of Quebec (Canada). In the case of Quebec, the reduction of combustion emissions is largely achieved through electrification of energy services. Global warming mitigation efforts reduce the impact on human health and ecosystem quality, mainly because of lower global warming, water scarcity, and metal contamination impacts.

In TFE/water, the helix begins after the positively charged N-terminal residues and is most stable in the hydrophobic core, which correlates with results obtained previously for other signal sequences. The helix is weaker between the hydrophobic core and the C-terminus; such a break in the helix appears to be common to other signal peptides studied previously and could be of functional importance. No clear correlation could be established between the helicity of the peptides in TFE/water and their in vivo activities. All the peptides have a higher alpha-helix content in SDS than in TFE/water, and there is a good correlation between helix content in SDS and in vivo activity. Helicity in SDS for the functional peptides increases both at the N-terminus and in the hydrophobic core, and is driven by a strong association of the core with the hydrophobic chains of the detergent. The extension of the helix toward the N-terminus may be a result of neutralization of the N-terminal positive charges by the headgroups of the micelles, which removes unfavorable electrostatic interactions with the helix dipole. All these comparisons were facilitated by the use of upfield shifts of H alpha protons in helical regions relative to random coil chemical shifts, which also yielded estimates of helical content that correlated well with the CD results.},

North American natural gas consumption has been growing due to its decreasing cost in North America, policy initiatives, and its relatively low CO2 emissions rate compared to coal. In this paper, we study the implications for the natural gas sector of more stringent RPS under different coordination schemes in an integrated North American natural gas market. The scenarios assume that Renewable Energy Certificates generated in each region are traded 1) among all countries, 2) only within each country, and 3) only within model regions. We implement the three policies in four different energy and electricity models to generate projections of future natural gas consumption. Subsequently, we feed regional or country-level consumption changes of each model in each scenario to the North American Natural Gas Model. We find that lower RPS coordination among regions results in increased U.S. natural gas exports to Canada, increased U.S. natural gas prices, and decreased net U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico in the long term. Moreover, international coordination of RPS in the electricity sector leads to smaller price discrepancies in the U.S. natural gas market when compared to the reference scenario.},

We employ the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES), a bottom-up energy system model, along with a U.S. data set developed for this analysis. To characterize EDV deployment through 2050, varying assumptions related to crude oil and natural gas prices, a CO2 policy, a federal renewable portfolio standard, and vehicle battery cost were combined to form 108 different scenarios. Across these scenarios, oil prices and battery cost have the biggest effect on EDV deployment. The model results do not demonstrate a clear and consistent trend toward lower system-wide emissions as EDV deployment increases. In addition to the trade-off between lower tailpipe and higher electric sector emissions associated with plug-in vehicles, the scenarios produce system-wide emissions effects that often mask the effect of EDV deployment. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

For instance, a pipeline may be subject to technical problems that reduce its capacity. Or, oil supply by tanker may be reduced for political reasons or because of equipment mishaps at the point of origin or again, by a conscious decision by the supplier in order to obtain economic benefits. The purpose of this article is to formulate a simplified version of the above issue that mainly addresses long-term uncertainties. The formulation is done via a version of the TIAM-WORLD Integrated Model, modified to implement the approach of robust optimization. In our case, the approach can be interpreted as a revival of chance-constrained programming under the name of distributionally robust, or ambiguous, chance-constrained programming. We apply the approach to improve the security of supply to the European Energy system. The resulting formulation provides several interesting features regarding the security of EU energy supply and has also the advantage to be numerically tractable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We use a newly developed bottom-up model of the entire Canadian energy system (TIMES-Canada) to assess potentials for electrification of the road transport sector. A special emphasis has been put on the modelling of the Canadian road transport, by considering a variety of vehicles for passenger and freight transportation. Besides a business-as-usual (baseline) scenario, we have analysed an energy policy scenario imposing targets for electric vehicle penetration and a climate policy scenario imposing targets for greenhouse gas emission reduction. Our analysis shows on the one hand that electric vehicles penetrate notably the passenger vehicle market after 2040 in the baseline scenario and after 2030 in the energy policy scenario (following the assumed penetration targets). On the other hand, the assumed climate policy forces a stronger penetration of electric vehicles for passenger transportation, with a progressive phasing out of internal combustion engine vehicles, whereas the latter vehicles remain dominant for freight transportation but with a shift away of fossil fuels and in favour of biofuels. A sensitivity analysis on the (assumed) evolution of electric vehicles over time confirms these general trends. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our analysis is based on NATEM, an energy model that follows the TIMES approach of the International Energy Agency to represent in detail the energy sector of each of the 13 Canadian provinces and territories. NATEM shows that imposing different renewable penetration constraints for electricity generation has limited impacts outside the electricity sector. In particular, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to increase over time. Conversely, the imposition of a carbon tax has broader impacts on Canadian energy systems and on GHG emissions that are almost stabilized. However, the level of the carbon tax envisions by the EMF 34 study (increasing to a maximum level of $130 per tonne by 2050) is not high enough, in a Canadian context, to trigger a decrease of GHG emissions over time as mandated by Canadian climate policies.},

Risk reduction goals are combined with securing a minimum level of revenues from the hydrocarbon exports goals.

abstract = {The concern of the environmental impacts of electricity generation from fossil fuels and the desire for the country to be less dependent on fossil fuels have resulted in the U.S. Government offering various incentives to promote electricity from renewable sources. The U.S. electricity generation sector faces uncertainties that include future demand, the costs of supply, and the effects of regulation policies. National policies that aim to promote " clean" energy sources may have different impacts for different areas of the country, so it is important to understand the regional effects in addition to the larger national picture. The primary purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the uncertainties associated with the outcomes of possible regulations.The study does not intend to make predictions of the probability or direction of environmental policy in the U.S. Rather, we examine a number of different scenarios and explore their possible impacts on the future of energy system. We focus on future projections for electricity generation mix, electricity costs, emissions and emissions abatement costs under different scenarios. We have examined the key regulations through analyzing various assumptions using the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model and the Environmental Protection Agency's Nine Region MARKAL Database (EPAUS9r).We have analyzed how command-and-control regulations and market-based environmental policy approaches could change the mix of fuels used for electricity generation, the amount of CO2 emissions, and the cost of electricity in different parts of the U.S. In particular, we explore how some proposed features of different policies designs affect those outcomes and identify underlying causes of uncertainty about such outcomes.The analyzed policies lead to 6-25% reduction in total CO2 emissions by 2035. The policies also result in modest increases on electricity costs nationally, but this masks a wide variety of effects across regions. The relationship between the policy's effects on costs depends on the design of the policy, regional resource endowments, and the existing generation mix of the region. Generally, the regions with existing high electricity marginal costs would tend to see only minor costs increases and the regions with low electricity marginal costs would see substantial costs increases. Modeling results illustrate that different regions have different preferences in environmental regulations policies and design.},

abstract = {Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are omnipresent in energy policy analysis. Even though IAMs can successfully handle uncertainty pertinent to energy planning problems, they render multiple variables as outputs of the modelling. Therefore, policy makers are faced with multiple energy development scenarios and goals. Specifically, technical, environmental, and economic aspects are represented by multiple criteria, which, in turn, are related to conflicting objectives. Preferences of decision makers need to be taken into account in order to facilitate effective energy planning. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools are relevant in aggregating diverse information and thus comparing alternative energy planning options. The paper aims at ranking European Union (EU) energy development scenarios based on several IAMs with respect to multiple criteria. By doing so, we account for uncertainty surrounding policy priorities outside the IAM. In order to follow a sustainable approach, the ranking of policy options is based on EU energy policy priorities: energy efficiency improvements, increased use of renewables, reduction in and low mitigations costs of GHG emission. The ranking of scenarios is based on the estimates rendered by the two advanced IAMs relying on different approaches, namely TIAM and WITCH. The data are fed into the three MCDM techniques: the method of weighted aggregated sum/product assessment (WASPAS), the Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method, and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). As MCDM techniques allow assigning different importance to objectives, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to check the impact of perturbations in weights upon the final ranking. The rankings provided for the scenarios by different MCDM techniques diverge, first of all, due to the underlying assumptions of IAMs. Results of the analysis provide valuable insights in integrated application of both IAMs and MCDM models for developing energy policy scenarios and decision making in energy sector.},

Some of the key strengths of the model include simultaneous optimisation of operation and investments across the complete energy system over the whole modelling horizon, explicit representation of the most important sectors of the economy, modular structure and the possibility of linking to a computable general equilibrium model for an additional insight on, e.g. public finance or CO2-leakage. TIMES-DK is being developed in close collaboration between an energy agency, a university and a consulting firm, to improve its robustness, relevance and impact on policy making. It allows for a wide range of applications including exploratory energy scenarios and policy analysis. To meet challenges of the future, further development of the model is needed and consequently the article provides references to ongoing projects addressing current development needs, such as improved representation of transport and flexible handling of the temporal dimension.

Energy systems optimisation modelling (ESOM) is a widely used tool to inform pathways to address long-term energy challenges. This article describes a new ESOM developed to inform Ireland's energy system decarbonisation challenge. The TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM) is an optimisation model of the Irish energy system, which calculates the cost-optimal fuel and technology mix to meet future energy service demands in the transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture sectors, while respecting constraints in greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy resources, and feasible deployment rates. TIM is developed to take into account Ireland's unique energy system context, including a very high potential for offshore wind energy and the challenge of integrating this on a relatively isolated grid, a very ambitious decarbonisation target in the period to 2030, the policy need to inform 5-year carbon budgets to meet policy targets, and the challenge of decarbonising heat in the context of low building stock thermal efficiency and high reliance on fossil fuels. To that end, model features of note include future-proofing with flexible temporal and spatial definitions, with a possible hourly time resolution, unit commitment and capacity expansion features in the power sector, residential and passenger transport underpinned by detailed bottom-up sectoral models, cross-model harmonisation, and soft-linking with demand and macro models. The paper also outlines a priority list of future model developments to better meet the challenge of deeply decarbonising energy supply and demand, taking into account the equity, cost-effectiveness, and technical feasibility.

This translates to annual energy demands of 40 GJ per person, compared with the current Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 116 GJ and the global average of 55 GJ.

abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas is a major challenge. The oil and gas industry must contribute to this goal, primarily by controlling natural gas flaring and venting, which is a multibillion revenue loss. More than 4000 billion cubic feet of gas is flared every year in the world, leading to almost 400 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. In Latin America, 7.4% of the total gas produced in the region is flared or vented. This article evaluates the status of the flaring and venting of gas in Latin America, focusing on the southern cone countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile). It also develops a long-term perspective analysis for the region, using an integrated optimization model. Findings indicate that, when transport infrastructure is limited or there is no domestic demand to absorb the associated gas, flaring becomes the least-cost solution in the optimization model. This can be critical in the next decade, due to the excess gas supply or the lack of gas demand to absorb it. Particularly, the natural gas demand associated with the electricity generation in Brazil is reduced by the hydroelectric expansion and a sluggish economy. Therefore, policies must promote options to monetize the stranded gas.},

abstract = {The International Energy Agency Energy Technologies Perspectives (ETP) model is used to assess the prospects for carbon abatement options, including carbon capture and storage, up to 2050. Three main scenarios are considered: a Baseline scenario with current energy policies, an accelerated technology scenario that seeks to return energy-related CO2 emissions in 2050 to their level in 2005, and a scenario for which CO2 emissions are reduced at 50% of current levels by 2050. To reach these emissions reduction targets, annual global CO2 emissions in the year 2050 must be reduced by 35 GtCO2 to 48 GtCO2 compared to the Baseline scenario. The analysis presented here shows that a broad portfolio of emissions reducing technologies will need to be deployed across all economic sectors of the global economy to reach these targets. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is one of the suite of technologies employed across the globe to reach these targets. CCS adoption occurs in many aspects of the global economy and accounts for 14-19% of all emissions reductions. The total amount of CO2 captured and stored in deep geologic reservoirs up to 2050 ranges between 5.1 GtCO2 and 10.4 GtCO2 in these two climate policy scenarios. Up to 2030, more than half of total CCS deployment takes place in OECD countries. After 2035, emerging economies account for more than half of total CCS use. This paper also demonstrates that as the climate policy becomes more stringent it will be necessary for CCS to deploy more extensively in many different industries outside of the electric power sector which often receives the most attention in discussions of CCS's role in addressing climate change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper provides a method to identify drivers, barriers and synergies (DBS) related to the deployment of a CO2 pipeline network. The method was demonstrated for the West Mediterranean region (WMR) (i.e. Spain, Portugal and Morocco). The method comprises a literature review, analysis of embedded pipeline trajectories, interviews with experts, and workshops with stakeholders. Subsequently, the collected information was used to identify route specific DBS in several CO2 pipeline network deployment scenarios that were modeled for the WMR. Most identified DBS apply to CO2 pipeline transport in general. The barriers (e.g. technical knowledge gaps, outstanding legislative issues, lack of financial incentive) can in principle be tackled to make the design, construction and operation of a CO2 pipeline network possible, but could sometimes lead to somewhat higher costs. Furthermore, there are also facilitating processes (e.g. experience with CO2 pipeline transport for EOR). Cost benefits due to pipeline oversizing were identified as a route specific driver, whereas crossings of mountains, water and nature areas are route specific barriers. Installing CO2 pipelines along natural gas pipelines could be either a route specific synergy or barrier, depending on site conditions. Finally, several key measures were proposed to enable CO2 pipeline networks in the future.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview and a critical analysis of the recent literature on incorporating induced technical change in energy systems models. Special emphasis is put on surveying recent studies aimed at integrating learning-by-doing into bottom-up energy systems models through so-called learning curves, and on analyzing the relevance of learning curve analysis for understanding the process of innovation and technology diffusion in the energy sector. The survey indicates that this model work represents a major advance in energy research, and embeds important policy implications, not the least concerning the cost and the timing of environmental policies (including carbon emission constraints). However, bottom-up energy models with endogenous learning are also limited in their characterization of technology diffusion and innovation. While they provide a detailed account of technical options - which is absent in many top-down models - they also lack important aspects of diffusion behavior that are captured in top-down representations. For instance, they often fail in capturing strategic technology diffusion behavior in the energy sector as well as the energy sector's endogenous responses to policy, and they neglect important general equilibrium impacts (such as the opportunity cost of redirecting R&D support to the energy sector). Some suggestions on how innovation and diffusion modeling in bottom-up analysis can be improved are put forward. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, municipalities have initiated the development of Sustainable Energy Action Plans as a key document to introduce the respective course of actions in order to define the technology adaptation process, identify the principal sources of CO2 emissions and their respective reduction potentials for the designated target years. A complete energy-strategy plan is required to handle the financial, technical, and environmental dimensions, not just for the country, but also for cities. As a powerful energy model generator among the energy planning and optimization tools, TIMES utilizes the energy, economy, and environmental parameters simultaneously. This paper aims to oversee and indicate the possible implications of “2023 energy targets” of Turkey in a city-level energy modeling. In this perspective, the city of Burdur is selected as the target to implement the designated solar energy policy targets. With this paper, nationwide official targets are evaluated for a city level by calculating long-term effects and costs to the system. A total of 5000 MW of solar energy utilization target of Turkey has been reduced to the urban level for Burdur, depending on its share of solar energy, and then applied as an alternative scenario on the energy model developed for this analysis. The results show that the solar share of the total installed capacity of Burdur city will reach 49% while tripling the solar-based electricity generation in its energy mix.},

abstract = {The influence of economic and demographic variables on the annual electricity consumption in Italy has been investigated with the intention to develop a long-term consumption forecasting model. The time period considered for the historical data is from 1970 to 2007. Different regression models were developed, using historical electricity consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita) and population. A first part of the paper considers the estimation of GDP, price and GDP per capita elasticities of domestic and non-domestic electricity consumption. The domestic and non-domestic short run price elasticities are found to be both approximately equal to -0.06, while long run elasticities are equal to -0.24 and -0.09, respectively. On the contrary, the elasticities of GDP and GDP per capita present higher values. In the second part of the paper, different regression models, based on co-integrated or stationary data, are presented. Different statistical tests are employed to check the validity of the proposed models. A comparison with national forecasts, based on complex econometric models, such as Markal-Time, was performed, showing that the developed regressions are congruent with the official projections, with deviations of ±1% for the best case and ±11% for the worst. These deviations are to be considered acceptable in relation to the time span taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Policies to encourage renewable electricity generation have grown at national and subnational levels. These measures are often characterized by geographical fragmentation, as jurisdictions typically select their own renewable targets without coordinating with neighboring regions. However, the literature on renewable policies has not examined the effects of cross-border interactions and coordination, especially in a multi-model comparison to examine robustness to structural and parametric uncertainties. This paper assesses the impacts of regional and international renewable policy coordination on economic, environmental, and planning outcomes in the North American power sector. Using a multi-model comparison with eight energy-economic models, the analysis demonstrates how prospective renewable mandate trade formulations impact power sector outcomes like capacity planning decisions, costs, emissions, trade, and infrastructure investments. Model results suggest that renewable policy coordination can lower costs by up to 20% for the stringencies examined here. Fragmentation lowers gas-fired generation, but coal and nuclear are also displaced, especially when regions comply without trade. Policy costs decrease for the U.S. with higher regional and international coordination, but magnitudes vary by model. Restricting coordination leads to higher capacity investments, and absent incentives to enhance efficiency, grids do not share resources to balance variability. Transmission investments and trade are highest with international policy coordination.},

When choosing the location for increased production capacity, the producer has typically limited incentives to take fully into account the investments costs of the subsequent need for increased grid capacity. This may lead to inefficient choices of location. We explore analytically the design of feed-in premiums that secure an optimal coordinated development of the entire electricity system. We show that with binding electricity transmission constraints, feed-in premiums should differ across locations. By the use of a numerical energy system model (TIMES), we investigate the potential welfare cost of a non-coordinated development of grids and wind power production capacity in the Norwegian energy system. Our result indicates that grid investment costs can be substantially higher when the location decision is based on uniform feed-in premiums compared with geographically differentiated premiums However, the difference in the sum of grid investment cost and production cost is much more modest, as location based on uniform feed-in premiums leads to capacity increase in areas with better wind conditions.},

abstract = {Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) currently have the challenge of high CAPEX mainly associated to the fuel cell. This study investigates strategies to promote FCEV deployment and overcome this initial high cost by combining a detailed simulation model of the passenger transport sector with an energy system model. The focus is on an energy system with 95% CO2 reduction by 2050. Soft-linking by taking the powertrain shares by country from the simulation model is preferred because it considers aspects such as car performance, reliability and safety while keeping the cost optimization to evaluate the impact on the rest of the system. This caused a 14% increase in total cost of car ownership compared to the cost before soft-linking. Gas reforming combined with CO2 storage can provide a low-cost hydrogen source for FCEV in the first years of deployment. Once a lower CAPEX for FCEV is achieved, a higher hydrogen cost from electrolysis can be afforded. The policy with the largest impact on FCEV was a purchase subsidy of 5 k€ per vehicle in the 2030–2034 period resulting in 24.3 million FCEV (on top of 67 million without policy) sold up to 2050 with total subsidies of 84 bln€. 5 bln€ of R&D incentives in the 2020–2024 period increased the cumulative sales up to 2050 by 10.5 million FCEV. Combining these two policies with infrastructure and fuel subsidies for 2030–2034 can result in 76 million FCEV on the road by 2050 representing more than 25% of the total car stock. Country specific incentives, split of demand by distance or shift across modes of transport were not included in this study.},

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) includes the combination of hydrogen with CO2 to produce liquid fuels and satisfy mostly transport demand. This study assesses the role of these pathways across scenarios that achieve 80–95% CO2 reduction by 2050 (vs. 1990) using the JRC-EU-TIMES model. The gaps in the literature covered in this study include a broader spatial coverage (EU28+) and hydrogen use in all sectors (beyond transport). The large uncertainty in the possible evolution of the energy system has been tackled with an extensive sensitivity analysis. 15 parameters were varied to produce more than 50 scenarios. Results indicate that parameters with the largest influence are the CO2 target, the availability of CO2 underground storage and the biomass potential. Hydrogen demand increases from 7 mtpa today to 20–120 mtpa (2.4–14.4 EJ/yr), mainly used for PtL (up to 70 mtpa), transport (up to 40 mtpa) and industry (25 mtpa). Only when CO2 storage was not possible due to a political ban or social acceptance issues, was electrolysis the main hydrogen production route (90% share) and CO2 use for PtL became attractive. Otherwise, hydrogen was produced through gas reforming with CO2 capture and the preferred CO2 sink was underground. Hydrogen and PtL contribute to energy security and independence allowing to reduce energy related import cost from 420 bln€/yr today to 350 or 50 bln€/yr for 95% CO2 reduction with and without CO2 storage. Development of electrolyzers, fuel cells and fuel synthesis should continue to ensure these technologies are ready when needed. Results from this study should be complemented with studies with higher spatial and temporal resolution. Scenarios with global trading of hydrogen and potential import to the EU were not included.},

This study focuses specifically on the methanation component of PtM in 2050. Scenarios with 80–95% CO2 reduction by 2050 (vs. 1990) are analyzed and barriers and drivers for methanation are identified. PtM arises for scenarios with 95% CO2 reduction, no CO2 underground storage and low CAPEX (75 €/kW only for methanation). Capacity deployed across EU is 40 GW (8% of gas demand) for these conditions, which increases to 122 GW when liquefied methane gas (LMG) is used for marine transport. The simultaneous occurrence of all positive drivers for PtM, which include limited biomass potential, low Power-to-Liquid performance, use of PtM waste heat, among others, can increase this capacity to 546 GW (75% of gas demand). Gas demand is reduced to between 3.8 and 14 EJ (compared to ∼20 EJ for 2015) with lower values corresponding to scenarios that are more restricted. Annual costs for PtM are between 2.5 and 10 bln€/year with EU28's GDP being 15.3 trillion €/year (2017). Results indicate that direct subsidy of the technology is more effective and specific than taxing the fossil alternative (natural gas) if the objective is to promote the technology.

This study analyses the role of different technologies in the EU-27 with regard to efficiency improvements, fuel switching and energy saving measures under such a climate policy target. The analysis is carried out using the regionalised Pan-European TIMES energy system model, a technology oriented, linear optimisation model. Thereby limited resources and import potentials of various energy carriers, competition among different sectors and the country-specific differences in energy demand are taken into account. As a result, it turns out that the structure of energy use inside the EU-27 is much stronger, influenced by political targets and positions regarding climate protection, energy security and the use of nuclear energy than by available technologies. In the case of climate protection polices and limited use of nuclear energy, the most important measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases are an increased use of renewables, carbon capture and storage, fuel switching and the intensified application of electricity in the end use sectors. Efficiency improvements play an additional role when security of supply is taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The need to have a suitable transport infrastructure, its implications over time and its related costs have only more recently attracting the attention and getting priority in the R&D agenda of the European Countries. This is partly because research on CO2 transport and storage needs to be realized at the localregional level, unlike the technological research on CO2 capture which is not country dependent.

abstract = {The integration of hydrogen energy systems in the overall energy system is an important and complex subject for hydrogen supply chain management. The efficiency of the integration depends on finding optimum pathways for hydrogen supply. Accordingly, energy systems modelling methods and tools have been implemented to obtain the best configuration of hydrogen processes for a defined system. The appropriate representation of hydrogen technologies becomes an important stage for energy system modelling activities. This study, split in consecutive parts, has been conducted to analyse how representative hydrogen supply pathways can be integrated in energy systems modelling. The current paper, the first part of a larger study, presents stylised pathways of hydrogen supply chain options, derived on the basis of a detailed literature review. It aims at establishing a reference hydrogen energy system architecture for energy modelling tools. The subsequent papers of the study will discuss the techno-economic assumptions of the hydrogen supply chain components for energy modelling purposes. {\textcopyright} 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {In this study, current and future anthropogenic hydrogen (H2) emissions to the atmosphere from technological processes are assessed. Current emissions are dominated by the direct exhaust gas of road-based motor vehicles and losses during the industrial production of H2 from fossil-fuels. H2 emissions from transportation are estimated at 4.5 Tg for 2010. An additional ∼0.5-2 Tg H2 are estimated to be lost to the atmosphere from industrial processes in 2010. In 2020, emissions from transportation are estimated at approximately 50% of those in 2010. Future emissions will occur as losses along the entire production, distribution, and end-use chain, including emissions from H2 fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). In 2050, overall anthropogenic H2 emissions will only approach current levels at high-end loss rates; direct emissions from transportation are expected to be significantly lower than current levels. In 2100, an average loss rate of 0.5% would result in overall H2 emissions exceeding current levels even with no net H2 emissions from FCVs. However, based on an average loss rate of 0.1%, H2 emission factors from FCVs on the order to 120-170 mg km-1 are projected to result in overall anthropogenic H2 emissions similar to 2010 levels. {\textcopyright} 2010 Professor T.

abstract = {Heterogeneous data, different definitions and incompatible models are a huge problem in many domains, with no exception for the field of energy systems analysis. Hence, it is hard to re-use results, compare model results or couple models at all. Ontologies provide a precisely defined vocabulary to build a common and shared conceptualisation of the energy domain. Here, we present the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) developed for the domain of energy systems analysis. Using the OEO provides several benefits for the community. First, it enables consistent annotation of large amounts of data from various research projects. One example is the Open Energy Platform (OEP). Adding such annotations makes data semantically searchable, exchangeable, re-usable and interoperable. Second, computational model coupling becomes much easier. The advantages of using an ontology such as the OEO are demonstrated with three use cases: data representation, data annotation and interface homogenisation. We also describe how the ontology can be used for linked open data (LOD).},

abstract = {Use of bioenergy can contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions and increased energy security. However, even though biomass is a renewable resource, the potential is limited, and efficient use of available biomass resources will become increasingly important. This paper aims to explore system interactions related to future bioenergy utilization and cost-efficient bioenergy technology choices under stringent CO2 constraints. In particular, the study investigates system effects linked to integration of advanced biofuel production with district heating and industry under different developments in the electricity sector and biomass supply system. The study is based on analysis with the MARKAL_Sweden model, which is a bottom-up, cost-optimization model covering the Swedish energy system. A time horizon to 2050 is applied. The results suggest that system integration of biofuel production has noteworthy effects on the overall system level, improves system cost-efficiency and influences parameters such as biomass price, marginal CO2 emission reduction costs and cost-efficient biofuel choices in the transport sector. In the long run and under stringent CO2 constraints, system integration of biofuel production has, however, low impact on total bioenergy use, which is largely decided by supply-related constraints, and on total transport biofuel use, which to large extent is driven by demand.},

Furthermore, biomass gasification could also be used for the efficient production of biofuels for transport. In this study, different applications of biomass gasification in connection to district heating (DH) are analysed and contrasted to conventional technology options. An application of the cost-optimizing energy system model MARKAL with a detailed description of the DH sector in a southwestern region of Sweden was developed within the study and used in the analysis. Policy measures for CO2 reduction and for promotion of "green" electricity are assumed, and required subsidy levels for large-scale production of transport biofuels are calculated. The model also operates with different supplies of biomass: a local supply at a lower cost and an international supply of refined biomass at a slightly higher cost. The study shows that investments in BIGCC CHP are often cost-efficient in cases with low ambitions regarding transport biofuels. However, due to limitations in heat demand and in local, lower cost, supply of biomass, investment in biofuel production means less investment in BIGCC CHP and, thereby, a smaller electricity production. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates requirements for policy support to overcome techno-economic barriers of biogas utilisation and effects of different biogas distribution strategies. Two potential sectors for biogas use are covered: the transport sector and the district heating sector. A quantitative, optimising, energy system modelling approach is applied and the region of V{\"{a}}stra G{\"{o}}taland, Sweden, is studied. The model has a high geographical resolution and locations of both biogas feedstock and potential markets are taken into account. The results show that a small part of the technical biogas potential can be cost-effectively utilised without biogas subsidies or larger infrastructural investments. Comparably low subsidies give significant increases in cost-effective biogas utilisation levels, but utilisation close to the full technical potential is linked to high subsidies. From a techno-economic perspective, biogas is best used as vehicle gas. Since local vehicle gas markets are limited, enhanced biogas distribution conditions not only imply larger total cost-effective biogas utilisation, but also a larger share of biogas as vehicle gas. Compared to distribution strategies based on truck transports and regional biogas grids, an expanded natural gas grid presents possibilities but also risks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

To formulate policies and to cost-effectively meet oil reduction objectives, assessments and comparisons of the long-term economic performances of different technology trajectories are essential. In this work, the energy and technology costs associated with reducing oil consumption in passenger cars in Sweden are calculated for a number of possible future transport fuel pathways and for different energy prices and climate policies. An optimisation model is applied in a simulatory multiple-run approach for this purpose. The model encompasses the transportation sector, as well as the stationary energy system. In terms of results, a methanol-based pathway gives incremental system costs in the range of - 0.9-3. billion EUR for a complete phase-out of passenger car oil up to 2030. As compared to the methanol pathway, other biomass gasification-based fuel pathways involve additional incremental system costs in the region of 3. billion EUR, whereas ethanol- and electricity-based pathways give additional incremental system costs of 4-5. billion EUR. At lower oil reduction levels, the cost differences between the pathways are smaller and the electricity-based pathway is significantly more cost-competitive. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {First and second generation biofuels are among few low-carbon alternatives for road transport that currently are commercially available or in an early commercialization phase. They are thus potential options for meeting climate targets in the medium term. For the case of Sweden, we investigate cost-efficient use of biofuels in road transport under system-wide CO2 reduction targets to 2050, and the effects of implementation of targets for an almost fossil-free road transport sector to 2030. We apply the bottom-up, optimization MARKAL_Sweden model, which covers the entire Swedish energy system including the transport sector. For CO2 reductions of 80% to 2050 in the Swedish energy system as a whole, the results of the main scenario show an annual growth rate for road transport biofuels of about 6% from 2010 to 2050, with biofuels accounting for 78% of road transport final energy use in 2050. The preferred biofuel choices are methanol and biomethane. When introducing additional fossil fuel phase-out policies in road transport (-80% to 2030), a doubling of the growth rate to 2030 is required and system CO2 abatement costs increases by 6% for the main scenario. Results imply that second generation biofuels, along with energy-efficient vehicle technologies such as plug-in hybrids, can be an important part of optimized system solutions meeting stringent medium-term climate targets.},

abstract = {Bioenergy could contribute both to the reduction of greenhouse gases and to increased energy security, but the extent of this contribution strongly depends on the cost and potential of biomass resources. For Sweden, this study investigates how the implementation of policies for CO2 reduction and for phase out of fossil fuels in road transport affect the future utilization of biomass, in the stationary energy system and in the transport sector, and its price. The analysis is based on the bottom-up, optimization MARKAL_Sweden model, which includes a comprehensive representation of the national energy system. For the analysis, the biomass supply representation of MARKAL_Sweden is updated and improved by the use of, e.g., forestry forecasting modeling and through construction of detailed biomass supply curves. A time horizon up to 2050 is applied. The results indicate a potential for significantly higher use of bioenergy. In the main analysis scenario, in which CO2 reduction of 80% by 2050 is imposed on the Swedish energy system, the total bioenergy utilization increases by 63% by 2050 compared to 2010. The largest increase occurs in the transport sector, which by 2050 accounts for 43% of the total primary bioenergy use. The high demand and strong competition significantly increase biomass prices and lead to the utilization of higher cost biomass sources such as stumps and cultivated energy forest, as well as use of pulpwood resources for energy purposes.},

In unconstrained emission scenarios, within the range of future technology performances considered in the present analysis, the cost of nuclear energy is shown to dominate all others in affecting future emissions.

abstract = {The clean development mechanism (CDM), one of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, has not received noticeable attention in the applied modeling literature. In this paper we develop a policy-oriented trading model explicitly including the key features likely to influence the supply and demand of CDM projects. This model allows us to evaluate the contribution of the CDM to climate policies at the national level. With an application to Belgium we show that the CDM could reduce the cost of the Kyoto Protocol by a factor 10. Policy analyses reveal that some features (e.g. the market share) have much more influence on this result than others (notably the transaction costs). Moreover, equilibrium effects can sometimes exceed direct effects so that, all in all, a larger domestic abatement could be justified by the desire to reduce what we call carbon dependence. Policy implications and perspectives for the CDM are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society for Policy Modeling.},

The project was a ‘first of its kind' piece of integrated modelling aimed at a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between the physical economy and natural resource use in Australia. The modelling allowed ground breaking results (Schandl et al. (2015) Australia is ‘free to choose' economic growth and falling environmental pressures, Nature DOI 10.1038/nature16065). Soon after, CSIRO and National Australia Bank (NAB) partnered to create the second phase of the Australian National Outlook, using CSIRO's next generation integrated modelling suite to investigate the issues most pertinent to the future success of Australia's economy. Australia's business community was engaged to highlight the issues most pertinent for the future of Australia's economy. The scope of ANO 2019 was significantly broader than ANO 2015, in that there was a greater focus on economic modelling as well as a consideration of cities, infrastructure, productivity and services. CSIRO and NAB harnessed the expertise of over 50 senior leaders (the Outlook Members) across 24 of Australia's top corporations, organisations and universities to pair with CSIRO's modelling and qualitative analysis. A full exploration of results and narrative interpretation can be read in the Australian National Outlook 2019 report (CSIRO and NAB (2019) Australian National Outlook. CSIRO, Australia).

abstract = {Future power systems will require large shares of low-carbon generators such as renewables and power plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to keep global warming below 2. °C. Intermittent renewables increase the system-wide demand for flexibility and affect the operation of thermal power plants. We investigate the operation of future power plants by first composing a comprehensive overview of the operational flexibility of current and future power plants. Next, a combined long-term optimization and hourly simulation is performed with the soft-linked MARKAL-NL-UU and REPOWERS models for The Netherlands in 2030 and 2050. We quantify and compare the technical and economic performance of power plants for four distinctly different future scenarios. We find that future low-carbon power systems will have large shares of intermittent renewable sources (19-42%) and also a 2-38% higher variability in residual load compared to the Baseline scenario. Hence, power plant operation will be more variable, which reduces their efficiency by 0.6-1.6% compared to the full-load efficiency. Enough flexibility is present in future power systems to accommodate renewables, due to advances in power plant flexibility and interconnectors. As a result, generators with CCS have a large market share (23-64% of power generated). Moreover, the current energy-based market model generates insufficient revenues: the price received per MWh covers only 84% (±30%) of the total generation costs per MWh of 77. €/MWh (±12€). This will discourage new investments in generation capacity and reduce power system adequacy. New or additional market designs may be required to ensure system adequacy in future power systems.},

abstract = {Vehicle automation has the potential to drastically transform transportation, with important implications for energy and the environment. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of automation on travel demand and vehicle efficiency. We utilize the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) energy system model to examine four previously published scenarios that consider different effects of automation on efficiency and demand. We do not replicate detailed estimation of individual mechanisms but apply key outcomes from prior studies within a broader energy system framework. Our analysis adds insights on fuel switching, upstream impacts, and air emissions. MARKAL dynamically captures interactions between transportation and non-transportation sectors, which is important given that the revolutionary shifts from automation may invalidate static assumptions. Model results suggest that increasing travel demands from automation may boost fuel use and petroleum-based fuel prices, potentially increasing the market penetration of alternative-fuel vehicles. In contrast, dramatic efficiency improvements from automation could drive fuel prices lower, greatly reducing the competitiveness of alternative-fueled vehicles. Furthermore, these shifts could yield positive or negative environmental impacts. Some automation scenarios even resulted in counterintuitive results. For example, if high levels of efficiency improvement drive out alternative-fuel vehicles, such as battery electric and hybrids, a net worsening of air quality relative to the other scenarios could result. We also found system-level dynamics to be key. For example, reductions in liquid fuel prices led to increased consumption, and the resulting increase in air pollutant emissions offset a portion of the potential air quality benefits of automation.},

abstract = {This study aims to determine how incorporating damages into energy costs would impact the US energy system. Damages from health impacting pollutants (NOx, SO2, particulate matter — PM, and volatile organic compounds — VOCs) as well as greenhouse gases (GHGs) are accounted for by applying emissions fees equal to estimated external damages associated with life-cycle emissions. We determine that in a least-cost framework, fees reduce emissions, including those not targeted by the fees. Emissions reductions are achieved through the use of control technologies, energy efficiency, and shifting of fuels and technologies used in energy conversion. The emissions targeted by fees decrease, and larger fees lead to larger reductions. Compared to the base case with no fees, in 2045, SO2emissions are reduced up to 70%, NOxemissions up to 30%, PM2.5up to 45%, and CO2by as much as 36%. Emissions of some pollutants, particularly VOCs and methane, sometimes increase when fees are applied. The co-benefit of reduction in non-targeted pollutants is not always larger for larger fees. The degree of co-reduced emissions depends on treatment of life-cycle emissions and the technology pathway used to achieve emissions reductions, including the mix of efficiency, fuel switching, and emissions control technologies.},

abstract = {Offshore wind is an established technology in Europe and Asia, but it has not yet gained market share in the United States. There is, however, increasing interest in offshore wind development in many coastal regions of the United States. As offshore wind grows in those regions it will displace existing and future electric generation assets, which will lead to changes in the emissions from the electric power sector. This research explores combinations of two electric sector drivers, offshore wind capital costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) caps, to measure the changes in the energy mix and quantify offshore wind's impact on electric sector emissions. An energy system modeling approach is applied, using a nested parametric sensitivity analysis, to generate and explore potential energy futures and analyze the air quality and greenhouse gas emissions benefits of offshore wind as an energy source. The analysis shows that offshore wind capacity was added due to cost reductions more than CO2 cap stringency, though both increased capacity additions. Capacity varied more by CO2 cap stringency at higher prices and less at lower prices. CO2 mitigation led to reductions in all five emissions investigated, regardless of offshore wind cost. Offshore wind-specific reductions were only consistent across all CO2 caps for CO2 and methane (CH4), though offshore wind-specific reductions were found for all emissions in the absence of CO2 caps. Results are presented nationally, analyzing the differences in adoption of offshore wind and how this technology provides a broader range of emission reduction options for the power sector.},

For this paper, 16 modeling teams reported resulting emissions projections, energy system evolution, and economic activity. This paper provides an overview of the study, documents the scenario design, provides a roadmap for complementary forthcoming papers from this study, and offers an initial summary and comparison of results for net-zero CO2 by 2050 scenarios in the United States. We compare various outcomes across models and scenarios, such as emissions, energy use, fuel mix evolution, and technology adoption. Despite disparate model structure and sources for input assumptions, there is broad agreement in energy system trends across models towards deep decarbonization of the electricity sector coupled with increased end-use electrification of buildings, transportation, and to a lesser extent industry. All models deploy negative emissions technologies (e.g., direct air capture and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) in addition to land sinks to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions. Important differences emerged in the results, showing divergent pathways among end-use sectors with deep electrification and grid decarbonization as necessary but not sufficient conditions to achieve net zero. These differences will be explored in the papers complementing this study to inform efforts to reach net-zero emissions and future research needs.},

abstract = {Circular economy is a new economic model that aims at overcoming today's linear “take, make, dispose” pattern, decoupling global economic development from finite resource consumption. Household appliances are a promising field for the adoption of Circular Economy, being one of the most resource-intensive industries and due to the global e-waste problem. The aim of this work is to quantify the potential contribution of making the household appliances sector more circular to the decarbonization of the Italian energy system, using the TIMES-RSE model. First, a literature review of the available circular measures was performed and used as a basis for modeling assumptions. The following circular measures were considered: extending the lifetime of appliances, increased adoption of remanufactured appliances, growing importance of leasing, lower average washing temperature for washing machines, and lower usage of tumble dryers. Second, each circular practice was modeled either as a new technology available for the optimization of the system or as a change in demand for a certain commodity. The reference scenario is the Italian Long Term Strategy. It is shown that the modeled circular practices can reduce the energy consumption of household appliances in 2050 by 0,327 Mtoe (−16%) and cut in half their costs through the 2020–2050 period, saving 96 billion euros (−47%). Moreover, savings could be even higher if efforts are taken to remove barriers to their diffusion, including consumers' habits and manufacturers' inertia. As the energy weight of appliances is low within the overall residential sector, energy savings of these circular practices are negligible at the sectoral level, however, economic savings of 107 billion euros are achieved over 2020–2050 (−22%).},

In England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for approximately half of all water abstractions and 40% of non-tidal surface water abstractions. We present a model that quantifies current water use of the UK electricity sector and use it to test six decarbonisation pathways to 2050. The pathways consist of a variety of generation technologies, with associated cooling methods, water use factors and cooling water sources. We find that up to 2030, water use across the six pathways is fairly consistent and all achieve significant reductions in both carbon and water intensity, based upon a transition to closed loop and hybrid cooling systems. From 2030 to 2050 our results diverge. Pathways with high levels of carbon capture and storage result in freshwater consumption that exceeds current levels (37-107%), and a consumptive intensity that is 30-69% higher. Risks to the aquatic environment will be intensified if generation with carbon capture and storage is clustered. Pathways of high nuclear capacity result in tidal and coastal abstraction that exceed current levels by 148-399%. Whilst reducing freshwater abstractions, the marine environment will be impacted if a shortage of coastal sites leads to clustering of nuclear reactors and concentration of heated water discharges. The pathway with the highest level of renewables has both lowest abstraction and consumption of water. Freshwater consumption can also be minimised through use of hybrid cooling, which despite marginally higher costs and emissions, would reduce dependence on scarce water resources thus increase security of supply. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Optimization modeling, scenario development, user interaction, policy analysis and visual display are seamlessly integrated into the UREM-IDSS. Uncertainties in energy-related parameters are effectively addressed through the interval linear programming (ILP) approach, improving the robustness of the UREM-IDSS for real-world applications. Thus, it can be used as an efficient tool for analyzing and visualizing impacts of energy and environmental policies, regional/community sustainable development strategies, emission reduction measures and climate change in an interactive, flexible and dynamic context. The Region of Waterloo has been selected to demonstrate the applicability and capability of the UREM-IDSS. A variety of scenarios (including a reference case) have been identified based on different energy management policies and sustainable development strategies for in-depth analysis of interactions existing among energy, socio-economy, and environment in the Region. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated, reflecting complex tradeoffs among energy-related, environmental and economic considerations. Results indicate that the UREM-IDSS can be successfully used for evaluating and analyzing not only the effects of an individual policy scenario, but also the variations between different scenarios compared with a reference case. Also, the UREM-IDSS can help tackle dynamic and interactive characteristics of the energy management system in the Region of Waterloo, and can address issues concerning cost-effective allocation of energy resources and services. Thus, it can be used by decision makers as an effective technique in examining and visualizing impacts of energy and environmental policies, regional/community development strategies, emission reduction measures, and climate change within an integrated and dynamic framework. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), chance-constrained programming (CCP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. ICS-EM allows uncertainties presented as both probability distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework. It can also facilitate capacity-expansion planning for energy-production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context. Complexities in energy management systems can be systematically reflected, thus applicability of the modeling process can be highly enhanced. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violation have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation and capacity-expansion plans with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and constraint-violation risks can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase system stability, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of potential instability of the management system. They are helpful for supporting (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy consumption, economic development and energy structure, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply security. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Management of energy resources is crucial for many regions throughout the world. Many economic, environmental and political factors are having significant effects on energy management practices, leading to a variety of uncertainties in relevant decision making. The objective of this research is to identify optimal strategies in the planning of energy management systems under multiple uncertainties through the development of a fuzzy-random interval programming (FRIP) model. The method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), superiority-inferiority-based fuzzy-stochastic programming (SI-FSP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Such a FRIP model allows multiple uncertainties presented as interval values, possibilistic and probabilistic distributions, as well as their combinations within a general optimization framework. It can also be used for facilitating capacity-expansion planning of energy-production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context. Complexities in energy management systems can be systematically reflected, thus applicability of the modeling process can be highly enhanced. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term energy management planning for a region with three cities. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems were generated. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violation were obtained. They could be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation and capacity-expansion plans with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and constraint-violation risks could be successfully tackled, i.e., higher costs will increase system stability, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of potential instability of the management system. Moreover, multiple uncertainties existing in the planning of energy management systems can be effectively addressed, improving robustness of the existing optimization methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper we investigate CO2 emission scenarios for Colombia and the effects of implementing carbon taxes and abatement targets on the energy system. By comparing baseline and policy scenario results from two integrated assessment partial equilibrium models TIAM-ECN and GCAM and two general equilibrium models Phoenix and MEG4C, we provide an indication of future developments and dynamics in the Colombian energy system. Currently, the carbon intensity of the energy system in Colombia is low compared to other countries in Latin America. However, this trend may change given the projected rapid growth of the economy and the potential increase in the use of carbon-based technologies. Climate policy in Colombia is under development and has yet to consider economic instruments such as taxes and abatement targets. This paper shows how taxes or abatement targets can achieve significant CO2 reductions in Colombia. Though abatement may be achieved through different pathways, taxes and targets promote the entry of cleaner energy sources into the market and reduce final energy demand through energy efficiency improvements and other demand-side responses. The electric power sector plays an important role in achieving CO2 emission reductions in Colombia, through the increase of hydropower, the introduction of wind technologies, and the deployment of biomass, coal and natural gas with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Uncertainty over the prevailing mitigation pathway reinforces the importance of climate policy to guide sectors toward low-carbon technologies. This paper also assesses the economy-wide implications of mitigation policies such as potential losses in GDP and consumption. An assessment of the legal, institutional, social and environmental barriers to economy-wide mitigation policies is critical yet beyond the scope of this paper.},

@article{Calvillo2017,
abstract = {The Scottish Government has set very ambitious targets and policies in its Climate Change Plan to decarbonise the 
energy system. The Scottish TIMES model is as a key tool informing these new climate change policies. TIMES is a well-known, widely used model. However, the adequacy of TIMES for energy efficiency policy analysis has not been assessed 
in the literature. 
This report sets out the potential for using TIMES to understand the system impacts of energy efficiency improvements, based upon work by climateXChange Fellow Christian Calvillo at Strathclyde University. 
This report describes the generic structure of the TIMES modelling framework to help a wider audience to understand 
the capabilities of this type of
 model. 
The report reviews energy efficiency related work in TIMES, and assesses the main 
strengths and limitations of TIMES. The main challenges identified in the specific context of using TIMES for 
energy efficiency analysis are:
•Energy efficiency implementation in TIMES is not straightforward. Several approaches could be followed, 
delivering potentially different results.
•Decisions are cost driven.   The cost minimisation   algorithm would lead to outcomes   involving extreme specialisation (corner solutions), if not prevented by user determined constraints (e.g. imposing 
maximum shares for different technologies).
•Energy demands and actions and reactions across the wider economy impacts are not modelled
within TIMES. More generally, market “problems” and other drivers for consumer behaviour are not captured. The report outlines several options to address or mitigate these modelling issues, and proposes ways forward in using
TIMES for energy efficiency analysis. The three main possibilities are:
1.Use TIMES as it is. This should be considered as the first step in energy efficiency analysis. The current versions 
of TIMES can deliver reasonable outputs and useful insight. However, any limitations of TIMES should be taken 
into account when interpreting the results.
2.Develop TIMES improvements. Implementing improvements in the specification of the TIMES 
model to deal with issues such as those outlined above is potentially a second step in the analysis of energy efficiency changes, one that is likely only to be feasible in the medium term. Some of these developments might require relatively little 
time and resources to implement, while others will require important changes on the model structure and data. 
Hence, an assessment of the potential benefits in relation to the required resources for a TIMES improvement 
must be done beforehand, as it might be more convenient to rely on soft-linking with other models.
3.Soft-linking with other models. That is, modelling the type of behaviours and sectors not captured in TIMES in 
other models and using the outputs to inform and/or interact with TIMES. 
This solution can potentially give relevant and/or more accurate information that could be very difficult to get from TIMES alone. In particular, the 
soft-linking with a 
multiple sector economy
-wide ‘computable general 
equilibrium (CGE) model approach is very relevant for energy efficiency policy analysis (and such a modelling framework is currently available to Scottish 
Government), as many of the expected outcomes go beyond the energy system (e.g. reducing energy poverty, job creation, economy boosts, etc.). In addition, this setup better represents consumer behaviour, which translates to more realistic technology adoption scenarios.},

abstract = {Electrifying transport to meet local pollution and overall net zero carbon ambitions is now a key UK policy focus, but this will have important impacts on the energy system, the economy, and the environment. Understanding the changes that the electrification of transport will bring is crucial for developing sustainable policies for net zero goals and a just transition. A literature is emerging to analyse the impact of a large-scale penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), but generally limiting focus to the implications for the electricity network. In this paper, we aim to provide insight on the wider energy system impacts of the expected EV rollout in the UK, in terms of fuel changes, energy costs, CO2 emission reduction and network investments; and how different EV charging strategies increase or mitigate the impacts of the expected large-scale penetration of EVs. Results show that non-smart and/or decentralised charging will require considerably larger investments on the network to accommodate new EV demand. Network reinforcement costs are passed to the consumer via increased electricity prices and, albeit reduced, emissions shift from the transport to the power sector. These results show the importance of considering the whole energy system and the wider economy, to avoid carbon leakage and to maximise the effectiveness of policies.},

In this article, we investigate the future trajectory of AFOLU GHG emissions in Latin America, with and without efforts to mitigate, using a multi-model comparison approach. We find significant uncertainty in future emissions with and without climate policy. This uncertainty is due to differences in a variety of assumptions including (1) the role of bioenergy, (2) where and how bioenergy is produced, (3) the availability of afforestation options in climate mitigation policy, and (4) N2O and CH4 emission intensity. With climate policy, these differences in assumptions can lead to significant variance in mitigation potential, with three models indicating reductions in AFOLU GHG emissions and one model indicating modest increases in AFOLU GHG emissions.},

CO2 reduction strategies accelerate the deployment of more water-efficient thermoelectric generation technologies and increase the use of renewables, nuclear, and carbon capture.

However, long-term climatic changes may affect the role of hydropower in meeting energy and climate policy objectives. The effects of climate change on runoff availability for hydropower generation are largely uncertain. This paper uses climate change scenarios derived from a large ensemble of Global Circulation Models as input for an energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) to examine least-cost options for the hydropower-dominated Ecuadorian power system in the period to 2050. This is done in the context of three policy cases in order to assess trade-offs between power system configuration, emissions and costs. The results show that in the long-term hydropower will remain as one of the most cost-effective and low emission technologies in the Ecuadorian power sector. However, constraints on deployment and uncertainty around climate change impacts could hinder its ability to contribute to the fulfilment of NDC targets, as well as create uncertainty around long-term power system costs. Strategies to hedge against these risks will likely require that hydropower expansion be complemented by alternative sources, namely incremental shares of thermoelectric generation with natural gas, biomass and geothermal energy.},

It soft-links two large-scale energy-economy models, EU-TIMES and NEMESIS, to shed light on opportunities and challenges related to delivering on the EU's 2030 climate targets. Results indicate that half the effort required to reach the updated 55% emissions reduction target should come from electricity decarbonisation, followed by transport. Alongside a post-COVID return to normal, the European Green Deal may lead to increased carbon prices and fossil-fuel rebounds, but these risks may be mitigated by certain behavioural changes, gains from which in transport energy use would outweigh associated consumption increases in the residential sector. Finally, the EU recovery mechanism could deliver about half the required investments needed to deliver on the 2030 ambition.},

This model depicts both household daily energy consumption and equipment purchasing behavior and focuses on the French residential and transport sectors. We show the importance of taking household heterogeneity into account in long-term planning models within the comparison of two energy price scenarios applied to two different models.

The research uses mixed methods, incorporating householder and energy expert surveys, scenario design utilizing the Japanese MARKAL/TIMES framework, and sustainability and social equity evaluation. Surveys identify householder energy system and participation preferences, alongside energy expert input on social equity and policy design. Scenario building is undertaken to compare energy system outcomes between the strategic Japanese policy approach and a user driven approach to energy transition, both cognizant of 2050 environmental goals. Both scenarios are comparatively assessed using a holistic sustainability evaluation process. Conclusions identify the impact of liberalization and subsequent householder participation in the energy system in Japan, when compared to a strategic, policy driven approach. Both approaches have positive ramifications on social equity and policy burden distribution outcomes. However, the household participation scenario delivers a more equitable outcome, distributing energy policy burdens in a fairer manner through the realization of an energy system which is safe, stable and affordable. The findings have practical applications in participatory policy design, and the development of energy policy which can achieve transition goals while being sensitive to householder preferences and social equity concerns.},

These energy efficiency classes and the respective market shares are a key model component in energy demand models, such as Forecast.. The agent-based model that will be developed is expected to interface with Forecast, by explicitly exploring how the decisions of individual households {\^{a}} in interaction, with others and intermediaries {\^{a}} affect these market shares.. We explore the connections of the models and provide input to the survey design. The document is structured as follows. Section 2 describes existing efforts in energy demand modelling and extracts key components that need to be taken into account in the CHEETAH modelling work. Section 3 describes existing agent-based models in order to draw lessons for the modelling work in CHEETAH. Section 4 includes conclusions on the most important findings and the lessons we draw for the design of the survey. This section presents also an overview of how the models in CHEETAH will be connected.},

We simulated possible pathways to meeting 2030 and 2050 emission targets within the Japanese electricity supply sector using a single-region model in The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES). Critically, our simulations incorporate novel technologies like hydrogen electrolysers, carbon capture, photochemical water splitting, and emerging photovoltaic cells, assess long-term impacts up to the year 2100, and include life-cycle emissions and learning curves for parameters such as investment cost, efficiency, and emission coefficients. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, using nuclear power and hydrogen from renewable energy-based electrolysis, is cost-effective and provides long-term emission reduction along with energy security. Nuclear, wind, solar, and hydrogen from renewables emerge as key emission reduction technologies, while natural gas with carbon capture plays a minor role in achieving emission reduction targets.},

This paper presents a new energy systems model for the Southern Cone region of Latin America, covering five regions (Argentina, Bolivia, South and Centre Chile, North Chile, and Brazil) with the aim to explore, up to 2030, the interplay between (i) the expected consumption of natural gas for electricity generation and end-use consumption (i.e. residential, commercial, transport and industry) in each country, (ii) the inter- and intra-country potential role as producer and consumer of natural gas, and (iii) the possible supply network of LNG and natural gas via pipeline and domestic production. It is found that, under a Constrained Investment Scenario, the gross domestic gas production of the Southern Cone from 2012 to 2030 could be 62 Tcf, whereas under an Unconstrained Scenario, it could rise to 75 Tcf. This highlights the economic potential of the unconventional gas resources of Argentina and projections of associated gas from the Campos and Santos basins in Brazil. However, accessing these resources poses financial challenges. Nonetheless, results clearly indicate significant potential for an increase in regional natural gas trade in the Southern Cone.},

abstract = {The natural gas exports from Argentina to Chile until the last decade represented a milestone for the energy integration aspirations in South America. Since the interruptions of Argentinian gas flows to Chile in 2004, this regional gas trade has been substituted by LNG imports. In 2016, Chile even started delivering gas to Argentina sourced by its LNG regasification terminals. However, tapping into unconventional gas resources in Argentina can reshape the supply-demand balance for these two countries. This study analysed the interplay between LNG and unconventional gas under two scenarios of investments in upstream supported by an integrated modelling tool for gas and power. In the Low-Investment Scenario in upstream, LNG imports increase significantly making it necessary to double the regasification capacity of Argentina by 2030. In the High-Investment scenario, where unconventional gas represents nearly half of natural gas domestic production in 2030, Argentina will rely on LNG only to meet winter demands. For Chile, in both scenarios tested, LNG remains relevant, requiring the construction of new regasification terminals. Still, developing unconventional resources as in the High-Investment scenario allows Argentina to re-take exports to Chile in the next decade, mainly in the summer season, providing another opportunity for discussions on energy integration in the region.},

abstract = {In this paper MARKAL-MACRO, an integrated energy-environment-economy model, is used to generate China's reference scenario for future energy development and carbon emission through the year 2050. The results show that with great efforts on structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement and energy substitution, China's primary energy consumption is expected to be 4818 Mtce and carbon emission 2394 MtC by 2050 with annual decrease rate of 3% for the carbon intensity per GDP during the period 2000-2050. On the basis of this reference scenario, China's marginal abatement cost curves of carbon for the year 2010, 2020 and 2030 are derived from the model, and the impacts of carbon emission abatement on GDP are also simulated. The results are compared with those from other sources. The research shows that the marginal abatement costs vary from 12US$/tC to 216US$/tC and the rates of GDP losses relative to reference range from 0.1% to 2.54% for the reduction rates between 5% and 45%. Both the marginal abatement costs and the rates of GDP losses further enlarge on condition that the maximum capacity of nuclear power is constrained to 240 GW or 160 GW by 2050. The paper concludes that China's costs of carbon abatement is rather high in case of carbon emissions are further cut beyond the reference scenario, and China's carbon abatement room is limited due to her coal-dominant energy resource characteristic. As economic development still remains the priority and per capita income as well as per capita carbon emission are far below the world average, it will be more realistic for China to make continuous contributions to combating global climate change by implementing sustainable development strategy domestically and playing an active role in the international carbon mitigation cooperation mechanisms rather than accepting a carbon emission ceiling. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The global climate change issue is becoming more and more important and hence to be the fourth challenge for China's future energy development, following energy supply shortages, energy security, and local environmental protection. This paper used three MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) family models, that is, MARKAL, MARKAL-ED (MARKAL with elastic demand), and MARKAL-MACRO, to study China energy system's carbon mitigation strategies and corresponding impacts on the economy. The models' structures and the economic feedback formulations used in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED are briefly described. The endogenous demands in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED enable them to partly satisfy carbon abatement constraints via energy service demand reductions, and the reduction levels for the 30 demand sectors from these two kinds of models for given carbon emission constraints are presented and compared. The impact of carbon mitigation on social welfare from MARKAL and MARKAL-ED, and on GDP, investment and consumption from MARKAL-MACRO are evaluated. The changes in both final and primary energy mix, changes in technology development, as well as marginal abatement costs for given carbon constraints from the three models, are analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {China's steel industry has grown significantly since the mid-1990s, and has been the backbone of Chinese heavy industry. It is also the most energy intensive industrial sector in China, accounting for 16.1% of total energy consumption in 2010. To assess energy consumption and CO2 emissions from China's steel industry, a system dynamics model and a bottom-up energy system model-TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) were used to analyze steel demand, energy consumption and CO2 emissions from China's iron and steel industry from 2010 to 2050. The model results suggest that steel production in China will rise from 627 Mt in 2010, to a peak of 772 Mt in 2020, and then gradually decrease to 527 Mt in 2050. The share of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel production will also increase significantly from 9.8% in 2010, to 45.6% in 2050. With the deployment of energy conservation technologies, such as Coke Dry Quenching, exhaust gas and heat recovery equipment, energy intensity and CO2 intensity of steel production will keep decreasing during the modeling period. In the near future, reductions in energy intensity and CO2 intensity will rely more on energy efficiency improvements; however, from a long-term perspective, structural change-the increasing share of EAF steel production, will be of great significance.},

In this chapter, multiple approaches, including the stock-based model, the saturation model, the discrete choices model, and so on, are used to project energy service demands from different demand sectors. The projections of energy service demand are used as inputs in the China TIMES-ED model to generate a reference scenario. Several carbon constraint scenarios have been designed to analyze the role of energy service demand reductions in industry, building and transport in the mitigation of carbon emissions in China.},

Ireland is an interesting case study due to the role of agriculture (a particularly challenging sector with regard to GHG emissions reduction), that represents 29% of Ireland's GHG emissions compared with less than 10% for the EU. The analysis is carried out with the Irish TIMES model, a bottom-up energy systems modelling tool with detailed characterization of Ireland's energy system. The paper uses scenario analysis to provide pathways that demonstrate how Ireland can meet the non-ETS target at least cost. The paper considers the impacts (in terms of different technology choices and higher marginal abatement costs) arising from higher targets for the energy system to compensate for growth in agriculture activity and low mitigation potential in that sector. The results point to a need to reconsider Ireland's renewable energy focus, with a need for increased effort in renewable transport and renewable heat in particular. The results also point to significant electrification of residential heating. The results also point to a high marginal abatement cost (€213/tCO2), which challenges the analysis carried out at EU level to establish Ireland's non-ETS target. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we have tried to investigate the current design (operational mechanism) of the policy, to examine the reasons for its problems, and to quantitatively predict future outlook. For the examination and prediction, we use the bottom-up model approach, which has not been commonly used for the RPS policy but is usually utilized for evaluating specific policy options in an energy system. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is not only to introduce a new approach for the exploration of the RPS policy, a scenario-based quantitative analysis based on a bottom-up energy system model, but also to apply the approach into the policy in Korea. We develop a multi-regional bottom-up energy model and explicitly implement the mechanism of the policy in the model, such as the transfer of tradable attribute - Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). The results of the model predict a serious disharmony of the current design of the policy under the national basic plan; the optimistic fulfillment rate of RECs in the entire mechanism will be around 66% in 2022, so the most regulated generators will suffer from the large shortfalls of RECs and the total penalty for all regulated generators will be expected up to 1350 billion KRW in 2022. We also diagnose the reasons of the disharmony as well as address some suggestions for its continued application. As the Korean case study, we believe that the approach in this study can be utilized when policy makers design or amend the mechanism of RPS with RECs to help the policy operate efficiently and to prevent potential undesirable consequences.},

The scenarios were defined in terms of three perspectives: the development level of key technologies, contribution of future renewable energy to the power generation sector, and relative importance of each hydrogen production method portfolio. All scenarios were based on the policies being considered by the Korean government. The results of the scenario analyses show, among others, that green hydrogen, i.e., water electrolysis-oriented hydrogen production, consumes a fairly large amount of electricity. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire national energy system, the transition of the power sector to renewable energy, mainly solar and wind energies, and the advancement of water electrolysis are required to reduce the national GHG emissions.},

Furthermore, we create a dynamic life-cycle inventory database to assess the changes in the future life-cycle environmental impact of a current product/process system. Our proposed method may guide industry to proactively prepare for the possible effects of different energy policies on their current product/process systems environmental profile so that they can make strategic decisions on modifications to, and investments in their production processes thereby to enhance their environmental- and economic-performance while meeting the various emission-abatement targets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As a member, South Korea has already proposed the reduction target and need to submit the achievement as a result of the policies and endeavors in the near future. In this paper, a Korean bottom-up energy system model to support the low-carbon national energy R & D roadmap will be introduced and through the modeling of various scenarios, the mid-to long-term impact on energy consumptions and CO2 emissions will be analyzed as well. The results of the analysis showed that, assuming R & D investments for the 11 types of technologies, savings of 13.7% with regards to final energy consumptions compared to the baseline scenario would be feasible by 2050. Furthermore, in the field of power generation, the generation proportion of new and renewable energy is expected to increase from 3.0% as of 2011 to 19.4% by 2050. This research also suggested that the analysis on the Energy Technology R & D Roadmap based on the model can be used not only for overall impact analysis and R & D portfolio establishment, but also for the development of detailed R & D strategies.},

abstract = {Background: This work explores the potential contribution of bioenergy technologies to 60% and 80% carbon reductions in the UK energy system by 2050, by outlining the potential for accelerated technological development of bioenergy chains. The investigation was based on insights from MARKAL modelling, detailed literature reviews and expert consultations. Due to the number and complexity of bioenergy pathways and technologies in the model, three chains and two underpinning technologies were selected for detailed investigation: (1) lignocellulosic hydrolysis for the production of bioethanol, (2) gasification technologies for heat and power, (3) fast pyrolysis of biomass for bio-oil production, (4) biotechnological advances for second generation bioenergy crops, and (5) the development of agro-machinery for growing and harvesting bioenergy crops. Detailed literature searches and expert consultations (looking inter alia at research and development needs and economic projections) led to the development of an 'accelerated' dataset of modelling parameters for each of the selected bioenergy pathways, which were included in five different scenario runs with UK-MARKAL (MED). The results of the 'accelerated runs' were compared with a low-carbon (LC-Core) scenario, which assesses the cheapest way to decarbonise the energy sector. Results: Bioenergy was deployed in larger quantities in the bioenergy accelerated technological development scenario compared with the LC-Core scenario. In the electricity sector, solid biomass was highly utilised for energy crop gasification, displacing some deployment of wind power, and nuclear and marine to a lesser extent. Solid biomass was also deployed for heat in the residential sector from 2040 in much higher quantities in the bioenergy accelerated technological development scenario compared with LC-Core. Although lignocellulosic ethanol increased, overall ethanol decreased in the transport sector in the bioenergy accelerated technological development scenario due to a reduction in ethanol produced from wheat. Conclusion: There is much potential for future deployment of bioenergy technologies to decarbonise the energy sector. However, future deployment is dependent on many different factors including investment and efforts towards research and development needs, carbon reduction targets and the ability to compete with other low carbon technologies as they become deployed. All bioenergy technologies should become increasingly more economically competitive with fossil-based technologies as feedstock costs and flexibility are reduced in line with technological advances. {\textcopyright} 2009 Clarke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper provides perspectives on the role of Latin American and Latin American countries in meeting global abatement goals, based on the scenarios developed through the CLIMACAP–LAMP modeling study. Abatement potential in Latin America, among other things, is influenced by its development status, the large contributions of non-CO2 and land use change CO2 emissions, and energy endowments. In most scenarios in this study, the economic potential to reduce fossil fuel CO2 as well as non-CO2 emissions in Latin America in 2050 is lower than in the rest of the world (in total) when measured against 2010 emissions, due largely to higher emission growth in Latin America than in the rest of the world in the absence of abatement. The potential to reduce land use change CO2 emissions is complicated by a wide range of factors and is not addressed in this paper (land use emissions are largely addressed in a companion paper). The study confirms the results of previous research that the variation in abatement costs across models may vary by an order of magnitude or more, limiting the value of these assessments and supporting continued calls for research on the degree to which models are effectively representing key local circumstances that influence costs and available abatement options. Finally, a review of policies in place in several Latin American countries at the time of this writing finds that they would be of varying success in meeting the emission levels proposed by the most recent IPCC reports to limit global temperature change to 2 °C.},

abstract = {It is anticipated that the decarbonisation of the entire energy system will require the introduction of large shares of variable renewable electricity generation into the power system. Long term integrated energy systems models are useful in improving our understanding of decarbonisation but they struggle to take account of short term variations in the power system associated with increased variable renewable energy penetration. This can oversimplify the ability of power systems to accommodate variable renewables and result in mistaken signals regarding the levels of flexibility required in power systems. Capturing power system impacts of variability within integrated energy system models is challenging due to temporal and technical simplifying assumptions needed to make such models computationally manageable. This paper addresses a gap in the literature by reviewing prominent methodologies that have been applied to address this challenge and the advantages & limitations of each. The methods include soft linking between integrated energy systems models and power systems models and improving the temporal and technical representation of power systems within integrated energy systems models. Each methodology covered approaches the integration of short term variations and assesses the flexibility of the system differently. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of these different methodologies are analysed. This review allows users of integrated energy systems models to select a methodology (or combination of methodologies) to suit their needs. In addition, the analysis identifies remaining gaps and shortcomings.},

abstract = {This work presents three 25-year energy scenarios developed with the TIMES model generator for Pesaro, a seaside municipality in central Italy. It evaluates the effectiveness of local-scale energy policies in three sectors: households, transport, and the public sector (PS). Since the local energy demand is affected by summer tourism, seasonal consumption by holiday homes was also studied. Three scenarios were hypothesized: Business as Usual (BAU), Exemplary Public Sector (EPS), and Exemplary Municipality (EM). The EPS scenario models the exemplary role that recent European directives attribute to the PS in setting energy efficiency and technology penetration targets for itself; the EM scenario extends these targets to the household sector. In particular, the study underscores the potential of micro-cogeneration technologies in achieving local environmental targets, even though their diffusion would involve an increase in local energy consumption due to internalization of the primary energy used to produce electricity, which would no longer be wholly imported from outside municipal boundaries. The study provides information to local decision-makers by estimating the cost of implementing a number of energy policies. Finally, the study discusses the adequacy of TIMES as a tool to analyse municipal-scale scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This work analyzes the public administration's role in energy and climate policies by assessing carbon-lowering measures for properties and services managed directly by local governments in central Italy. Both short- and long-term schemes were considered in the analysis of local authority energy strategies. The MARKAL-TIMES energy model was applied to long-term energy planning to assess the effect of low-carbon initiatives on public-sector energy consumption up to 2030. Two energy scenarios were built, i.e. a Business As Usual (BAU) scenario based on current or soon-to-be-adopted national policies, and an Exemplary Public Scenario (EPS) including some further virtuous local policies suggested by local authorities. Our results show that a 20% primary energy reduction can be achieved with respect to the baseline year by means of short-term energy policies (5-year time span), while a primary energy saving of about 30% can be reached with longer-term energy policies (25-year time span), even after taking the increase in energy demand into account.

abstract = {This study investigates the potential of energy efficiency, renewables, and micro-cogeneration to reduce household consumption in a medium Italian town and analyses the scope for municipal local policies. The study also investigates the effects of tourist flows on town's energy consumption by modelling energy scenarios for permanent and summer homes. Two long-term energy scenarios (to 2030) were modelled using the MarkAL-TIMES generator model: BAU (business as usual), which is the reference scenario, and EHS (exemplary household sector), which involves targets of penetration for renewables and micro-cogeneration. The analysis demonstrated the critical role of end-use energy efficiency in curbing residential consumption. Cogeneration and renewables (PV (photovoltaic) and solar thermal panels) were proven to be valuable solutions to reduce the energetic and environmental burden of the household sector (-20% in 2030). Because most of household energy demand is ascribable to space-heating or hot water production, this study finds that micro-CHP technologies with lower power-to-heat ratios (mainly, Stirling engines and microturbines) show a higher diffusion, as do solar thermal devices. The spread of micro-cogeneration implies a global reduction of primary energy but involves the internalisation of the primary energy, and consequently CO2 emissions, previously consumed in a centralised power plant within the municipality boundaries. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The analysis is based on the Baseline and Alternative scenario results, where hydrogen reaches a significant share. The two scenarios constitute the starting points to analyse the hydrogen potential among the possible energy policy options. The energy demand in the Baseline scenario reaches values around 240 Mtoe at 2030, with an average annual growth of 0.9%. The Alternative scenario reduces consumption down to 220 Mtoe and stabilizes the CO2 emissions. The Alternative scenario expects a rapid increase of hydrogen vehicles in 2030, up to 2.5 million, corresponding to 1 Mtoe of hydrogen consumption.

In this context, a regional model of the energy system is a useful tool to give insights to policy makers. We address the lack of an existing integrated tool by developing a technology-rich, bottom-up model for the region. The goal of this paper is twofold: we present the model and its functioning and then we analyse a cost-optimal way to reach the −55% regional target. Firstly, we describe the methodology, discussing how we build the sectors of our model and how the optimisation works. Secondly, we run the model with a constraint on GHG emissions to assess the impact of the mitigation target. We show that the total system cost of such an ambitious mitigation scenario is only ∼0.5% higher than the cost of an unconstrained reference scenario and that emissions reduction must start as soon as possible to stay on the cost-effective trajectory. Concerning technologies, windmills, photovoltaic (PV) panels and building renovations are cost-optimal solutions even with high discount rates.},

abstract = {Sustainability of energy systems requires drastic changes of production and consumption standards, in order to fulfil energy and material demand with a lower quantity of resources and to reduce the whole impacts including also the environmental damages caused by the human activities. The internalisation of external costs in the pricing system can actually drive consumers' behaviour towards sustainable choices and life standards. In the last 20 years a great interest of the scientific community has been devoted to identify and monetarise the damages on human health and on environment caused by energy-related activities and to give guidance for supporting the design of internalisation measures. First studies on these issues were carried out at the beginning of the nineties, in the framework of the EU-funded ExternE project and dealt with an assessment of the externalities from a wide range of different fuel cycles (nuclear, fossil fuels, renewable sources). The ExternE methodology has been further improved, validated and extended in the framework of the NewExt, ExternE-Pol and in the NEEDS projects. At the same time, energy system analysis, developed since the late seventies in response to the oil crisis, has been further extended to include environmental issues and more specific economic evaluations. A major role in this framework, has been played by the MARKAL/TIMES family of models developed by IEA-ETSAP, largely utilised worldwide to support decision makers in understanding and planning the future behaviour of energy systems, over a medium-long term period. Starting from a detailed technology- economic-environmental characterisation of the analysed energy system, from demand to supply side, the MARKAL/TIMES based models identify the optimal configuration on the time horizon considered, in compliance with exogenous constraints (resources availability, pollutants reduction, etc.). Based on this background research, the integration of energy system analysis methods with externalities assessments represents a powerful tool to support a systemic multi-objective investigation, aimed at achieving a better resource management as well as at reducing environmental pollution. This chapter is addressed to describe, from a methodological and an operating point of view, how strategic energy planning can benefit from external costs evaluation. Thus an applicative example is provided, presenting the main results obtained for the integrated Italy energy model are presented and the same general conclusions for policy guidelines are derived.},

However, their diffusion requires huge capital investment and major infrastructure changes, which have to be assessed to verify their effectiveness. The article present an application of the R-MARKAL model to investigate the feasibility of renewable use on a local case study for electricity and thermal energy production. A comprehensive modelling approach is used to emphasise the relationships and feedback between conversion and demand sectors (residential, services and commercial), taking into account contemporaneously legal issues and physical limits of the system. The model's solutions represent the minimum cost choice and the results show that even in absence of exogenous environmental constraints, many renewable technologies are profitable demand device and their investment costs are paid off in a medium term by lower operating and maintenance expenditures. In this context the use of thermal energy from incinerator allows one to achieve a consistent reduction of atmospheric pollutant emissions and, particularly, of greenhouse gases emissions due to waste degradation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To analyse different decarbonization pathways for the energy system, existing models have traditionally focused on specific energy sectors, adopted specific research perspectives, assessed only certain technologies, or studied isolated components and factors of the energy system. However, few efforts have been undertaken to successfully model a broader picture of the energy-economic system. In this conceptual paper, we propose linking top-down and bottom-up models to represent: distributed generation and demand, operations of electricity grids, infrastructure investments and generation dispatch, and macroeconomic interactions. We review existing work on modelling the different dimensions of the energy transition to understand why models tend to focus on certain features or parts of the energy system. We then discuss methodologies for linking different type of models. We describe our integrated modelling framework, and the challenges and opportunities on linking models based on their capabilities and limitations.},

abstract = {This paper examines different carbon pathways for achieving deep CO2 reduction targets for the UK using a macro-econometric hybrid model E3MG, which stands for Energy-Economy-Environment Model at the Global level. The E3MG, with the UK as one of its regions, combines a top-down approach for modeling the global economy and for estimating the aggregate and disaggregate energy demand and a bottom-up approach (Energy Technology subModel, ETM) for simulating the power sector, which then provides feedback to the energy demand equations and the whole economy. The ETM submodel uses a probabilistic approach and historical data for estimating the penetration levels of the different technologies, considering their economic, technical and environmental characteristics. Three pathway scenarios (CFH, CLC and CAM) simulate the CO2 reduction by 40%, 60% and 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels respectively and are compared with a reference scenario (REF), with no reduction target. The targets are modeled as the UK contribution to an international mitigation effort, such as achieving the G8 reduction targets, which is a more realistic political framework for the UK to move towards deep reductions rather than moving alone. This paper aims to provide modeling evidence that deep reduction targets can be met through different carbon pathways while also assessing the macroeconomic effects of the pathways on GDP and investment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

GEP is a complex task, combining techno-economic, financial, spatial and environmental characteristics. Several models are developed to model GEP, applying different methodological approaches. The underlying theory is very important as it might inherit bias in the resulted outcomes. The debate on the appropriateness of each methodology is increased, especially as projected outlooks deviate from reality. The paper aims to provide a review of the models employed to integrate RES in the GEP. The paper classifies models in three generic categories: optimisation models, general/partial equilibrium models and alternative models, not adopting the optimum integration of RES in the GEP.

This study uses two newly developed global top-down and bottom-up models with a regional China focus to compare China's future energy and CO2 emission pathways toward 2050. By harmonizing the economic and demographic trends as well as a carbon tax pathway, we explore how both models respond to these identical exogenous inputs. Then a soft-linking methodology is applied to "narrow the gap" between the results computed by these models. We find for example that without soft-linking, China's baseline CO2 emissions might range from 15-20 Gt in 2050, while soft-linking models results in 17 Gt. Reasons for the results gap between the models are discussed subsequently, such as model structure and statistical inputs. At a sectoral level, the gap can be mainly traced to China's future coal use in electricity production. The study finds that it is beneficial to soft-link complex global models under harmonized assumptions. Although this study fails to "close the gap" between the two models completely, the experiences and insights shared here will be beneficial for researchers and policy makers that are drawing conclusions from the results of China and global scenario studies.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, analyzing issues within the ‘water-energy nexus' has become a topic of increasing attention for the scientific and policy communities. Based on an extensive survey of recent scientific literature on the water-energy nexus, 70 studies were identified and 35 were selected as comprehensive case studies for review. The reviewed studies were classified and assessed according to groupings based on both geographic scale and their ‘nexus scope'. In addition to providing a depository summary of a wide range of current existing methods and tools for water-energy nexus analysis, the paper discusses these approaches based on their main purposes. From this review, it is clear that the research on water-energy nexus has seen a significant increase in both the number of studies and the capacity of the scientific community to productively assess water and energy interlinkages at a higher resolution. At the same time, this review has also concluded that, while many studies aim to develop new methods and frameworks to comprehensively assess interactions between water, energy and other elements, none can or do provide a singular framework for performing a “nexus study”. Furthermore, many researches are at the “understanding” stage with an emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the water-energy nexus. Fewer approaches are designed to support governance and implementation of technical solutions, and this is considered to a priority challenge area for the scientific community if it aims to achieve greater impact on resource policy and management. There is a clear need to improve our ability to classify and compare the capacities, strengths and weaknesses between existing approaches. This would better enable a wider group of stakeholders to utilize existing knowledge to improve their effective management of water and energy resources. It could also help focus the scientific community to more effectively improve upon the existing knowledge base and to increase focus on “governing” and “implementing” the nexus.},

The CO2 emission reduction targets and limiting the use of imported fossil fuels put a strain on the fuel mixture planning of electricity sector. In this study, least cost electricity generation based on various fuel mixtures with and without external costs are determined while achieving an optimal solution for emission reduction targets or keeping the fuel share as it was in the base year (business as usual, BAU). The optimization is developed between 2016 and 2035 using ANSWER-TIMES energy planning simulation program taking 2015 as the base year. The results show that by internalizing external costs renewable energy power plants are promoted in long term. The fossil fueled power plants are primarily preferred to meet the demand when the external costs of electricity generation are not considered during optimization. The scenario results also presented that the total discounted costs increase by 4% for CO2 mitigation scenario relative to BAU scenario when external costs are not considered in optimization. However, total discounted system costs are increased by about 30% for both CO2 mitigation and BAU scenarios when external costs are considered in optimization. The scenario results also presented that the CO2 emissions can be reduced by about 30% when optimizations are performed considering the external costs and emission targets.},

With the integrated assessment model TIAM-ECN we project how large its contribution could be in Europe in the power sector and industry, and analyze how this contribution may be affected by cost decline (driven by technological innovation) and ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. If Europe stays on track of achieving zero net emissions by mid-century, we find that CO2 capture activities in Europe may grow to a total amount of some 1700 MtCO2/yr in 2050. We project that by 2050 power plants equipped with CCS could contribute by approximately 25 % to total electricity generation, in competition with low-carbon alternatives such as nuclear energy and renewables like solar photovoltaic and wind power. CCS in association with the use of natural gas could account for about 35 % of energy use in industrial applications, while the use of biomass and coal combined with CCS could be employed for the production of hydrogen. We find that stringent climate policy measures constitute a bigger driver of broad CCS diffusion than CCS technology cost reductions. We project that under stringent climate policy targeting zero net emissions by 2050, a 30 % CCS capital cost reduction as a result of technological advancement could proffer Europe by the middle of the century a saving of about 17 billion US$/yr in additional energy system costs.},

abstract = {Supporting investments in energy efficiency is considered a robust strategy to achieve a successful transition to low-carbon energy systems in line with the Paris Agreement. Increased energy efficiency levels are expected to reduce the need for supply-side investments in controversial technologies, such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear energy, and to induce a downward push on carbon prices, which may facilitate the political and societal acceptance of climate policies, without adversely affecting living comfort and sustainable development. In order to fully reap these potential benefits, economies need to design policy packages that balance emission reduction incentives on both the demand and the supply side. In this paper we carry out a model-comparison exercise, using two well-established global integrated assessment models, PROMETHEUS and TIAM-ECN, to quantitatively analyze the global system-level effects of increased energy efficiency in the context of ambitious post-COVID climate change mitigation scenarios. Our results confirm the expected benefits induced by higher energy efficiency levels, as in 2050 global carbon prices are found to decline by 10%–50% and CO2 storage from CCS plants is 13%–90% lower relative to the “default” mitigation scenarios. Similarly, enhanced energy efficiency reduces the additional average yearly system costs needed globally in 2050 to achieve emission reductions in line with the Paris Agreement. These additional costs are estimated to be of the order of 2 trillion US$ – or 1% of global GDP – in a well-below-2 °C scenario, and can be reduced by 6–30% with the adoption of higher energy efficiency standards. While the two models project broadly consistent future trends for the energy mix in the various scenarios, the effects may differ in magnitude due to intrinsic differences in how the models are set up and how sensitive they are to changes in energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.},

With the updated version of TIAM-ECN, we quantify how large the share of geothermal energy in Europe could grow until 2050, and analyze how this expansion could be stimulated by climate policy and technological progress. We investigate geothermal energy's two main applications: power and heat production. For the former, we project an increase to around 100–210 TWh/yr in 2050, depending on assumptions regarding climate ambition and cost reductions for enhanced geothermal resource systems. For the latter, with applications in residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, we anticipate under the same assumptions a rise to about 880–1050 TWh/yr in 2050. We estimate that by the middle of the century geothermal energy plants could contribute approximately 4–7% to European electricity generation. We foresee a European geothermal energy investment market (supply plus demand side) possibly worth about 160–210 billion US$/yr by mid-century.},

abstract = {In this paper Kenya's climate change mitigation ambitions are analysed from an energy system perspective, with a focus on the role of renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies. At COP-21 in 2015 in Paris, Kenya has committed to a ‘nationally determined contribution' of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2030 in comparison to a business-as-usual projection. An efficient exploitation of the country's renewable energy resources is key to achieving this target. We use the TIAM-ECN model to characterize plausible development pathways for the Kenyan energy mix until 2050 under different climate change mitigation scenarios. We conclude that the power sector can expand with mostly renewable energy options even in the absence of stringent greenhouse gas abatement targets. On the contrary, on the demand side a substantial deployment of low-carbon technologies is triggered only when ambitious emission reduction objectives are in place. The introduction of these technologies entails additional energy system costs, ranging in 2050 from 0.5% to 2% of the country's GDP. Our analysis supports the feasibility of Kenyan climate management goals, provided that adequate investments in renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies are timely made available.},

This paper describes a novel methodology for incorporating competition between private cars, buses and trains in a least-cost linear optimisation E4 model, called TIMES. This is achieved by imposing a constraint on overall travel time in the system, which represents the empirically observed fixed travel time budget (TTB) of individuals, and introducing a cost for infrastructural investments (travel time investment, TTI), which reduces the travel time of public transport. Two case studies from California and Ireland are developed using a simple TIMES model, and results are generated to 2030 for a reference scenario, an investments scenario and a CO 2 emissions reduction scenario. The results show that with no travel time constraint, the model chooses public transport exclusively. With a travel time constraint, mode choice is determined by income and investment cost assumptions, and the level of CO 2 constraint, with greater levels of public transport in the mitigation scenario. At low travel investment cost, new rail is introduced for short distances and increased bus capacity for longer distances. At higher investment costs rail is increasingly chosen for long distances also.},

abstract = {The development of the energy system model IFE-TIMES-Norway started in 2017 in cooperation with Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). This report describes the model version 2 from November 2021, with several updates made throughout the model since previous model documentation (2020). The model is based on earlier versions of TIMES-Norway (2009) and MARKAL-Norway (1992). The model development is dynamic with continuously methodological developments. IFE-TIMES-Norway is a long-term optimisation model of the Norwegian energy system that is generated by TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) modelling framework. TIMES is a bottom-up framework that provides a detailed techno-economic description of resources, energy carriers, conversion technologies and energy demand. TIMES models provide investments and operational decisions that minimize the total discounted cost of a given energy system that meets the future demand for energy services. The total energy system cost includes investment costs in both supply and demand technologies, operation and maintenance costs, and income from electricity export to and costs of electricity import from countries outside Norway. IFE-TIMES-Norway is a technology-rich model of the Norwegian energy system that is divided into five regions that corresponds to the current spot price areas of the electricity market. The model provides operational and investment decisions from the starting year, 2018, towards 2050, with model periods for every fifth year from 2020 within this model horizon. To capture operational variations in energy generation and end-use, each model period is split into 96 sub-annual time slices, where four seasons is represented by 24 hours each. The model has a detailed description of end-use of energy, and the demand for energy services is divided into numerous end-use categories within industry, buildings and transport.},

This research designed scenarios to model the prospective influences of the liquid vehicles elimination using Global TIMES model. Results show that energy consumption and direct carbon emissions of global transport sector in prohibition scenarios are expected to decrease by 54.1% and 84.8% in 2050 compared to SSP2 and electrification rate of global transport sector may reach 60.5%. Cumulative direct carbon emissions of global transport sector can accomplish the RCP2.6 mitigation target, which is allocated to transport sector by the model, if the median prohibition time will be prior to 2035. Nevertheless, the RCP2.6 mitigation goal is not expected to be achieved considering the indirect emissions from the increasing electricity consumption in global transport. Therefore, the substitution of electric vehicles for liquid vehicles should be accompanied with the decarbonization of global power sector.},

Applying the energy system model MARKAL and scenario analysis, this paper examines and quantifies the role of clean and advanced energy technologies for efficient local resource exploitation and improving energy security and environmental conditions. The main focus is on the power sector and the paper also addresses the potential ASEAN markets for European energy technologies. The paper concludes that there is a large potential market for clean and advanced energy technologies in the studied countries. If adopted, these technologies will bring several benefits like reduction in primary energy requirement, reduced investments requirement in the power sector and other parts of the energy infrastructure, reduced import of primary energy, reduced CO2 emissions and local pollution, reduced energy system costs and marginal cost of electricity supply. Finally, barriers for transfer and diffusion of advanced energy technologies are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bangladesh, currently a low middle-income economy aspires to become a high middle income country by 2021. To achieve such aspiration, the country will have to ensure adequate power supply for its fast growing economy. Bangladesh lacks energy resources for power generation. This paper explores some of the power supply scenarios with special focus on power imports and higher use of renewables. Using the technology rich, least cost optimization model ‘The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES)' the authors developed four possible future power supply scenarios for Bangladesh. These scenarios include an energy security framework (based on the Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2016 report), a high power import scenario, a scenario with higher use of renewables and a combined high power import - high renewables development scenario. The analysis indicates that the present energy security framework ensures energy security with diversifying fuels used for power generation, however, scenarios with high power imports and a high share of renewables (including the combined scenario) bring down the cost of supplying power along with a reduction in expensive fossil fuel imports while maintaining energy security as fuel sources for power generation still remain diversified.},

This is incorporated in an energy system planning model with high spatial and temporal resolution. An advanced bottom-up energy system modeling framework is used to develop the model. The North-Indian power sector is considered as a case study with the analysis of renewable energy penetration and curtailment levels, technology capacity, and role of storage and inter-regional energy exchange for many future energy transition scenarios. Various model cases indicate system transition towards high renewable energy penetrated generation portfolio. Solar energy curtailment is prominent in high renewable scenarios. Coal-based power plants are important generation options unless drastic high CO2 price is considered. Storage systems work as energy arbitrage devices. Quantifying intra-regional renewable energy capacity and generation potential and incorporating them in a long-term planning model with many annual time slices is a contribution to the current modeling practices. Analysis of varied sensitivity cases adds value to long-term large-scale variable renewable energy integration planning approaches.},

abstract = {Power system operational uncertainties of load fluctuation, and unplanned outage of generating units, or lines are normally handled by reserve generation or transmission capacity. The output of conventional generators is quite controllable, and load variation is predictable within a certain confidence limit. On the other hand, output of variable renewable generators is random and uncontrollable. Large-scale integration of these resources introduces additional uncertainty to an existing system. This drastic change in generation paradigm underscores the need for additional flexible capacity to maintain reliable system operation. Conventional long-term planning studies tend to overestimate system's ability to integrate renewable energy and underestimate flexibility requirement due to inherent modeling limitations. Mathematical models that are used in these planning exercises adopt simplified spatial and temporal resolution and often neglect real system operation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new planning strategies to reflect short-term renewable energy resource intermittency in long-term decision making. In this article, the implication of RE intermittency in system operation and also their impact on long-term planning is discussed. Recent planning approaches from literature which aim to address these issues, have been highlighted. A critical discussion regarding their usefulness is also presented.},

abstract = {The analysis in this paper builds on a previous China MARKAL modeling effort to further explore alternative energy-technology strategies and assess the extent to which they could enable China to meet its social and economic development goals while ensuring national energy-supply security and promoting environmental protection and sustainable development. The present analysis is intended to help sharpen the focus on key strategic issues, policies, and programs for promoting an advanced energy-technology strategy in general and coal polygeneration technology in particular. The detailed assessment of coal polygeneration technology is warranted because of its potentially central role in providing clean synthetic transportation fuels as well as electricity. The paper explores the following set of specific issues: (1) the costs and benefits of advanced energy-technology strategies compared to strategies based on coal combustion for electricity generation and direct coal liquefaction to produce liquid fuels, (2) the impact that delays in the introduction of polygeneration technologies might have on overall energy system costs and on meeting environmental and energy security goals, (3) the impact of future, crisis-induced oil price shocks, (4) the impact of insufficiently aggressive end-use energy efficiency efforts, and (5) the relative costs of achieving reductions in air pollution and CO2 emissions with different energy-technology strategies. The analysis indicates that an energy development strategy based on advanced technologies, including efficient end-use technologies, renewables, and coal gasification-based energy supply technologies, can enable China to meet economic development, clean air, energy security and greenhouse gas mitigation targets consistent with sustainable development. A "business-as-usual" strategy, even including direct coal liquids technology, cannot meet target caps on oil and gas imports. In addition, the analysis indicates that over the 55-year modeling period (1995 to 2050) an advanced technology strategy would involve only a small (1 %) increase in total energy-system cost compared with a "business-as-usual" strategy. The advanced technology strategy requires significantly higher capital investments in energy technologies, but these result in significantly lower fuel costs, especially from reduced fuel imports. {\textcopyright} 2003 International Energy Initiative, Inc.},

A multi-model approach is used to explore and rank alternative plans (combinations of actions and measures) towards the sustainable development of the municipality, with a particular focus on the residential and transport sectors. On the basis of the possible space of decisions of the municipality (which can be seen as "urban planner", as "regulator", as "provider of support and information", as "consumer" and as "supplier" of energy), alternative planning hypotheses have been prepared and tested making use of a city-energy system model and scenario analysis. Scenarios are built around different themes with the aim of exploring the potential benefits (or drawbacks) of the combination of specific "competitive" projects, actions, standards, targets. A reference development of the local system is assumed to be modified through six combinations of actions and measures aiming at representing six pillars of alternative pathways towards the sustainability. Figures below report the key themes and hypotheses taken into consideration in the planning exercise. Once the dynamic pictures of the urban system are produced (one per each alternative), a multi-criteria method is used to determine the ranking of the options, evaluated against a set of elements (technological, social, environmental, economic). This stage is still ongoing and will generate the whole dataset (weights, preference functions) required to rank the alternatives in the next few months. All these alternative strategies are designed with the involvement of the municipality of Cesena, to directly respond their needs of knowledge about potential impacts of different action plans. Compared to the existing city strategic energy action plans, the advantage of the outputs of this approach is the fact that multiple future energy scenarios are analysed and cross-compared and "integrated" strategies ranked.},

We apply the methodology and present and discuss the results. The motivation for this soft-linking is to provide a transfer of information from the power systems model strong points to the energy systems model and use this information to improve and develop understanding of energy systems model results. Part of this motivation is derived from a view that one specific energy modeling tool cannot address all aspects of the full energy system in great detail and greater insights and progress can be gained by drawing on the strengths of multiple modeling tools rather than trying to incorporate them all into one comprehensive model. The methodology takes an optimized generation portfolio for a specific year from an energy systems model and undertakes a detailed high resolution chronological simulation of the same portfolio in the power systems model with added degrees of technical detail. Results presented here show that in the absence of key technical constraints, an energy systems model can potentially undervalue flexible resources, underestimate wind curtailment and overestimate the use of baseload plant. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

System security is viewed here as a multidimensional systemic property of the entire energy system. The paper shows that the different dimensions of a secure energy system are correlated, and hence their behaviour cannot be explained solely by an understanding of the individual dimensions or by system elements in isolation. The implication of this is that a proper assessment of the security of a power system requires a combination of different techno-economic models. The paper develops a comprehensive multi-model approach for investigating energy security issues within power systems, and applies it to a case study focussing on the Italian power sector. The core research activity involves using an energy systems model of Italy (MONET) to build a dedicated power systems model (PLEXOS-IT) and then undertaking a soft-linking exercise between the two models. The purpose is to use PLEXOS-IT to investigate the system adequacy of the power system results produced by MONET for future possible energy system scenarios.},

abstract = {Energy-economy optimization models - encoded with a set of structured, self-consistent assumptions and decision rules - have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant MGA alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of MGA as an energy modeling technique. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper MARKAL integrated energy system model is applied to explore the impacts and opportunities for low emissions energy system development in Macedonia, identifying CO2 emission reduction policies and the cost of taking action. Two scenarios with different reduction target have been examined: higher ambition scenario where emissions are restricted to 10% above 1990 levels in 2021 and 2.5% in 2030, and moderate ambition scenario where emissions are restricted to 25% above 1990 levels in 2021 and 15% in 2030. In order to provide insights into the optimal timing of emission reductions, both of these cases have also been run under cumulative constraints, that is, rather than having the specified annual targets, there is a carbon "budget" set for 2015-2030 (44 Mt and 26 Mt for higher and moderate ambition cases, respectively), reflecting the same ambition as the above cases but providing flexibility to reduce emissions in the most cost-optimal way. The results show that most of the CO2 reductions are in the power generation sector, which is not surprising as this tends to be the most carbon intensive sector. The higher ambition case is considerably more expensive than the reference case, with costs 1.9% higher, while the increase under the moderate ambition case is 1%. Under a cumulative constraint, the additional costs are reduced to 1.5% and 0.6% respectively, highlighting the importance of the timing of action.},

abstract = {Recent US data indicate a clear and progressive decoupling of carbon emissions and energy intensity from economic growth. This is primarily a consequence of state and national environmental and energy policy actions, and secondarily a result of shifts in economic structure and increases in natural gas supplies. To assess future opportunities of proactive approaches to policy and investment, we analyze 20 sector-based actions at the national and subnational levels in the US that can narrow remaining national carbon emissions gaps by 2020 and beyond, while improving economic and energy efficiency in every sector. These actions are found to provide favorable returns on investment for job creation, energy and cost savings, and multiple measures of energy security. Selection and design of these new actions are based on evaluation of hundreds of policy options derived from facilitated, stakeholder and consensus-based development of comprehensive climate action planning in 20 states. They represent top issues of focus for policymakers, and serve as key drivers for new investment, collaboration, and governance approaches that are needed to integrate economic, energy, and environmental security in the US. This same general approach to planning and analysis is of value to other nations seeking similar benefits. Techniques for comprehensive, multi-objective, fully integrated, and collaborative systems of planning and analysis are important as a means for comprehensive security solutions. This also requires leadership at all levels of government, and a broadened view of national security.},

Among those covered by the scheme, this sector is one of the most exposed, since it is both highly CO2-intensive and relatively open to international trade. We also examine the robustness of these results to various assumptions: marginal abatement cost curve, trade and demand elasticities, as well as pass-through rates and updating of allocation rules, of which the latter two are scarcely debated. We conclude that for this sector, competitiveness losses are small. We prove this conclusion to be robust. Hence arguments against tightening the environmental stringency of the ETS in Phase II are not justified on grounds of competitiveness loss. Our systematic sensitivity analysis allows us to identify the important assumptions for each output variable. It turns out that pass-through rates and updating rules are significant, despite being often implicit and least debated in existing analyses. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on the role of a potential niche market for cars with a limited travel range and how this may affect overall deployment of alternative drivetrain technologies and fuel choice. The results show that assuming a market of substantial size for such short-range cars leads to technologies such as BEVs being deployed more readily.

Introducing a strong decarbonisation constraint, for instance, profoundly modifies the power sector, which is impacted by increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources. Long-term modelling tools working on different assumptions increasingly factor in these impacts, the assessment of which requires a clear description and categorization of the technical and economic choices for representing the tools in question. A new typology based on a literature review is presented for both power sector models and long-term models of the energy system. New comparing criteria focussing on the power sector's components are put forward, such as electricity storage and grid. An analysis carried out by means of this categorization on five chosen models shows that, up until now, energy modelling tools and power system tools have been designed to meet separate objectives and have not combined their advantages.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles have attracted the attention of India's policy makers as clean technology alternatives due to their multiple advantages like higher efficiency and lower air pollution in short to medium term and reduced CO2 emissions as electricity gets decarbonized in the long-run under low carbon scenarios. This paper uses an energy system model ANSWER-MARKAL to analyse the role of electric vehicles (EV) in India. The modelling assessment spans the period 2010 to 2050 and analyses future EV demand in India under three scenarios: i) a ‘Reference' scenario which includes the continuation of existing EV policies as outlined in India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC); ii) a ‘EV policy' scenario which, in line with India's INDCs, follows targeted supply-side push policies for EVs, but without the budget constraints; and iii) a ‘low carbon' scenario which uses an exogenous price for CO2 in line with the global target of 2 °C temperature stabilization. The scenarios analysis delineates penetration of EVs and their co-benefits as well as co-costs. The co-benefits relate to local air quality, national energy security and CO2 emissions in India whereas the co-costs (risks) are related to sourcing of raw materials for batteries and battery reprocessing and disposal. The findings show that: i) in the reference scenario, the EVs 2-wheelers will achieve a significant share by 2050. Electric 4-wheelers though would have a small share even in 2050; ii) EV push policies though lead to significant diffusion of electric 2- wheelers in India by 2030. These policies enhance diffusion of electric 4-wheelers only if financial incentives are sustained in the long-term, iii) the application of global carbon price on the Indian economy in the 2° C stabilization scenario increases competitiveness of EVs and results in near total share of electric 2-wheelers by 2030 and a sizable share of electric 4-wheelers by 2050. The high and rising carbon price in low carbon scenario cause deep decarbonisation of electricity and enables EVs to deliver deep cut in CO2 emissions. The results show asymmetry in the impacts of national and global policies on co-benefits from EV. The EV supply-push policies deliver moderate benefits vis-{\`{a}}-vis air pollution and energy security indicators but make insignificant contribution CO2 emissions reduction. On the other hand, the global carbon price in the global 2° C stabilization scenario delivers sizable co-benefits vis-{\`{a}}-vis all three indicators. This asymmetry reveal important policy insights: i) the policy sequencing is vital to gain co-benefits, ii) EV technology push policies are good for creating early domestic market for a clean vehicle technology but they may not deliver sizable co-benefits vis-{\`{a}}-vis CO2 emissions which are global externalities, and iii) implementing strong climate policies early would lead to EVs delivering high co-benefits, in case of India, vis-{\`{a}}-vis all three indicators.},

abstract = {Dependence on oil for transport is a concern for India's policymakers on three counts - energy security, local environment and climate change. Rapid urbanisation and accompanying motorisation has created some of the most polluting cities in India and rising demand for oil is leading to higher imports, besides causing more CO2 emissions. The government of India wants to achieve the climate goals through a sustainability approach that simultaneously addresses other environment and developmental challenges. This paper analyses a sustainable low carbon transport (SLCT) scenario based on sustainable strategies for passenger and freight mobility, vehicle technologies and fuel using global CO2 prices that correspond to 2°C global stabilisation target. The scenarios span from years 2010 to 2050 and are analysed using the energy system model-ANSWER MARKAL. The SLCT scenario has improved energy security (cumulative oil demand lower by 3100Mtoe), improved air quality (PM 2.5 emissions never exceed the existing levels) and the cumulative CO2 emissions are lower by 13billiontCO2 thereby showing that achieving development objectives with CO2 co-benefits is feasible.},

The teams also modeled the comprehensive scenario which included policy measures from individual scenarios. The paper concludes that all of the measures provide strong co-benefits in reducing air pollutants and CO2 emissions. The modeling results show that the increased energy efficiency of passenger and freight vehicles has the largest potential for reducing both CO2 and PM2.5 emissions.

Energy system analysis provides a sound methodology to assess energy needs, allowing to investigate the energy system behavior and to individuate the optimal energy-technology configurations for the achievement of strategic energy and environmental policy targets. In this framework, the estimation of future trends of exogenous variables such as energy demand has a fundamental importance to obtain reliable and effective solutions, contributing remarkably to the accuracy of models' input data. This study illustrates an application of regression analysis to predict energy demand trends in end use sectors. The proposed procedure is applied to characterize statistically the relationships between population and gross domestic product (independent variables) and energy demands of Residential, Transport and Commercial in order to determine the energy demand trends over a long-term horizon. The effectiveness of linear and nonlinear regression models for energy demand forecasting has been validated by classical statistical tests. Energy demand projections have been tested as input data of the bottom-up TIMES model in two applications (the TIMES-Basilicata and TIMES-Italy models) confirming the validity of the forecasting approach.},

In fact these models enable the users to perform a scenario analysis in order to explore the behaviour of energy system to boundary conditions variations. They are typically characterized by a huge amount of data which informative content is often not fully exploited. In this framework, multivariate statistical techniques (Cluster Analysis - CA and Principal Component Analysis - PCA) can represent a key tool to characterize data correlation structure and to point out the variables with the highest information content.

The IEA-ETSAP methodology was utilized to model and analyse the Basilicata energy system in a business-as-usual scenario, based on the assumptions of the 2010 Regional Energy and Environmental Policy Plan, and in two low-carbon scenarios, decarbonisation and high energy efficiency, which, in line with the long-term European strategy, foresee an 85% carbon dioxide emission reduction and a 20% energy efficiency increase in 2050. The results highlight that electricity production from renewable energy sources (in particular wind energy), strongly supported by the regional policy, goes beyond the Basilicata Regional Energy-Environmental Plan forecast, with a further increase in the decarbonisation scenarios. In addition, solar thermal and highly efficient technologies are adopted in commercial and residential end-use sectors. An additional 9% reduction in energy consumption is achieved in the high energy efficiency scenario by passive houses. The proposed approach shows the usefulness of a modelling framework typically used for national and supranational analyses to support regional authorities in their decision-making process to obtain results in line with the European and national strategies. Application to the Basilicata region shows the usefulness of a consolidated framework for policy assessment at a local scale to assess regional contribution to the achievement of national climate mitigation targets that tend towards climate neutrality.},

New dynamics are occurring with cities becoming vectors of sustainable development, through initiatives like the Covenant of Mayors. Innovative approaches and tools are required to support city development planning in compliance with climate change mitigation goals. City planning and management are typically addressed through a fragmented and silo approach, failing to capture the dynamics and complexity of a city energy system. Integrated energy system modelling tools are progressively incorporating increasing realism to enhance results quality and confidence. This paper demonstrates the effects of including household budget constraints in integrated energy system optimisation modelling on low carbon city pathways. The TIMES_EVORA model was used to characterize current and future city energy system, covering all its chain, from energy supply sectors (e.g. electricity production) to end use sectors (e.g. residential and transport). Optimal solutions for meeting {\'{E}}vora municipality (Portugal) 2030 greenhouse gases emissions targets were assessed, combining household budget constraints for the acquisition of more efficient technologies – from appliances to private vehicles. The results showed a decrease of hybrid vehicles ownership in 2030 and a consequent increase of diesel vehicles. The optimal model solution shows a persistence in the acquisition of highly efficient households' appliances and the deployment of additional PV systems to facilitate a reduction of the electricity generation CO2 footprint. This allows to offset the transport CO2 emission increase and provide benefits across all energy system. Improving the integration of behavioural or real-life aspects in energy system optimisation models allows further understanding of city energy systems dynamics and provide robust city decarbonization strategies design. Cities sustainable energy system and urban planning should include different agent's investment constraints in order to avoid technology deployment locking that can compromise cities sustainable pathways.},

However, few residential energy system models have been developed for the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region and they do not account for the key diversities of energy use within the sector. This paper addresses this gap by developing a new residential energy model for Nigeria—the most populous country in SSA. The model is then used to explore different energy transition scenarios for the sector. Results indicate that the final energy consumption of the rural households will reduce and that of the urban households will increase significantly by 2050 when compared to the base year levels. The results indicate that cooking remains the most energy-intensive end-use. Analysis of the scenarios reveals that realising Sustainable Development Goal number 7 in Nigeria will drastically reduce the final energy demand of the sector. The transition from fuelwood to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking will reduce indoor air pollutants considerably but will increase CO2 emissions by 2050. The results also indicate that including the cost of externalities in energy cost makes electricity and biogas more economically viable options for cooking. While the model results are insightful, the paper argues that robust and dedicated policies are needed for a sustainable energy transition of the Nigerian residential sector.},

abstract = {The accelerated growth in biofuel markets has both created and reinforced linkages between agriculture and energy. The evolution of biofuel markets over the next 10-20years and the implications for energy, agriculture, and the environment are uncertain. Building on an integrated agriculture-energy modeling framework, this study analyzes a baseline and three alternative scenarios: two scenarios based on energy prices (crude oil and natural gas) and one based on assumptions regarding cellulosic biomass availability. By examining the impact of scenarios driven by (a) changes in the energy sector and (b) changes in the agricultural sector, we can compare the differential effects on biofuels markets, commodity prices and quantities in each sector, and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Scenario comparisons show biofuel markets affected more by crude oil prices than natural gas prices. However, higher natural gas prices shift the biofuel production mix away from corn-grain based to more cellulosic ethanol via multiple mechanisms. Alternatively, the scenario with no cellulosic feedstock lowers total ethanol production and raises ethanol and corn prices. In terms of environmental impacts, higher ethanol levels driven by higher oil prices lead to lower CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. In comparison, the no cellulosic scenario results in the highest CO<inf>2</inf> trajectory relative to the baseline.},

abstract = {The UK government heat strategy is partially based on decarbonisation pathways from the UK MARKAL energy system model. We review how heat provision is represented in UK MARKAL, identifying a number of shortcomings and areas for improvement. We present a completely revised model with improved estimations of future heat demands and a consistent representation of all heat generation technologies. This model represents all heat delivery infrastructure for the first time and uses dynamic growth constraints to improve the modelling of transitions according to innovation theory. Our revised model incorporates a simplified housing stock model, which is used produce highly-refined decarbonisation pathways for residential heat provision. We compare this disaggregated model against an aggregated equivalent, which is similar to the existing approach in UK MARKAL. Disaggregating does not greatly change the total residential fuel consumption in two scenarios, so the benefits of disaggregation will likely be limited if the focus of a study is elsewhere. Yet for studies of residential heat, disaggregation enables us to vary consumer behaviour and government policies on different house types, as well as highlighting different technology trends across the stock, in comparison with previous aggregated versions of the model. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {One option to decarbonise residential heat in the UK is to convert the existing natural gas networks to deliver hydrogen. We review the technical feasibility of this option using semi-structured interviews underpinned by a literature review and we assess the potential economic benefits using the UK MARKAL energy systems model. We conclude that hydrogen can be transported safely in the low-pressure pipes but we identify concerns over the reduced capacity of the system and the much lower linepack storage compared to natural gas. New hydrogen meters and sensors would have to be fitted to every building in a hydrogen conversion program and appliances would have to be converted unless the government was to legislate to make them hydrogen-ready in advance. Converting the gas networks to hydrogen is a lower-cost residential decarbonisation pathway for the UK than those identified previously. The cost-optimal share of hydrogen is sensitive to the conversion cost and to variations in the capital costs of heat pumps and micro-CHP fuel cells. With such small cost differentials between technologies, the decision to convert the networks will also depend on non-economic factors including the relative performance of technologies and the willingness of the government to organise a conversion program. {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {There has recently been a concerted effort to commence a transition to fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) in Europe. A coalition of companies released an influential McKinsey-coordinated report in 2010, which concluded that FCVs are ready for commercial deployment. Public-private H2Mobility programmes have subsequently been established across Europe to develop business cases for the introduction of FCVs. In this paper, we examine the conclusions of these studies from an energy systems perspective, using the UK as a case study. Other UK energy system studies have identified only a minor role for FCVs, after 2030, but we reconcile these views by showing that the differences are primarily driven by different data assumptions rather than methodological differences. Some energy system models do not start a transition to FCVs until around 2040 as they do not account for the time normally taken for the diffusion of new powertrains. We show that applying dynamic growth constraints to the UK MARKAL energy system model more realistically represents insights from innovation theory. We conclude that the optimum deployment of FCVs, from an energy systems perspective, is broadly in line with the roadmap developed by UK H 2Mobility and that a transition needs to commence soon if FCVs are to become widespread by 2050. {\textcopyright} 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this paper, we develop the principle of model archaeology as a formal method to quantitatively examine the balance and evolution of energy system models, through the ex post analysis of both model inputs and outputs using a series of metrics. These metrics help us to understand how models are developed and used and are a powerful tool for effectively targeting future model improvements. The usefulness of model archaeology is demonstrated in a case study examining the UK MARKAL model. We show how model development has been influenced by the interests of the UK government and the research projects funding model development. Despite these influences, there is clear evidence of a strategy to balance model complexity and accuracy when changes are made. We identify some important long-term trends including higher technology capital costs in subsequent model versions. Finally, we discuss how model archaeology can improve the transparency of research model studies.},

abstract = {Energy system models are often used to assess the potential role of hydrogen and electric powertrains for reducing transport CO2 emissions in the future. In this paper, we review how different energy system models have represented both vehicles and fuel infrastructure in the past and we provide guidelines for their representation in the future. In particular, we identify three key modelling decisions: the degree of car market segmentation, the imposition of market share constraints and the use of lumpy investments to represent infrastructure. We examine each of these decisions in a case study using the UK MARKAL model. While disaggregating the car market principally affects only the transition rate to the optimum mix of technologies, market share constraints can greatly change the optimum mix so should be chosen carefully. In contrast, modelling infrastructure using lumpy investments has little impact on the model results. We identify the development of new methodologies to represent the impact of behavioural change on transport demand as a key challenge for improving energy system models in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {The UK has an extensive natural gas pipeline network supplying 84% of homes. Previous studies of decarbonisation pathways using the UK MARKAL energy system model have concluded that the low-pressure gas networks should be mostly abandoned by 2050, yet most of the iron pipes near buildings are currently being replaced early for safety reasons. Our study suggests that this programme will not lock-in the use of gas in the long-term. We examine potential future uses of the gas network in the UK energy system using an improved version of UK MARKAL that introduces a number of decarbonisation options for the gas network including bio-methane, hydrogen injection to the natural gas and conversion of the network to deliver hydrogen. We conclude that hydrogen conversion is the only gas decarbonisation option that might enable the gas networks to continue supplying energy to most buildings in the long-term, from a cost-optimal perspective. There is an opportunity for the government to adopt a long-term strategy for the gas distribution networks that either curtails the iron mains replacement programme or alters it to prepare the network for hydrogen conversion; both options could substantially reduce the long-term cost of supplying heat to UK buildings. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Currently, electricity production in Reunion Island is mainly based on imported fuels while it is blessed with high levels of renewable energy potentials. The issue addressed in this paper is the technical and economical feasibility of this ambitious target. The approach relies on a prospective study conducted by the TIMES-Reunion model which provides future production mixes according to different scenarios. It is combined with a quantitative assessment of reliability of power supply with two reliability indicators, regarding that intermittent sources may highly develop and consequently worsen reliability. This study enables us to draw three main conclusions: (i) electricity autonomy can be achieved thanks to high levels of biomass production and of intermittent sources; (ii) however, since fuel oil's power plants appear as back-up units, the reliability of power supply will be lowered. This is illustrated by the decrease of the reliability indicators over the time horizon; (iii) however, provided that appropriate rules on the instantaneous production are enforced, a generation mix that both complies with the electricity autonomy target and with a satisfying reliability of power supply is possible.},

It is usually ensured by controlling voltage and frequency deviations and involves events occurring from a few milliseconds to a few hours. However, reliability requirements are largely ignored when dealing with long-term issues. To reconcile such contrasting timescales, it seems logical to rely on energy considerations based on thermodynamics. Two reliability indicators, assessing the magnetic and kinetic energy reserves of a power system, are derived from this approach. They enable to quantify the reliability of a given production mix and make it possible to choose between increasing shares of intermittent sources and maintaining an expected level of reliability. Since the indicators tackle reliability issues without focusing on a specific timescale, they are effective for both discussing the long-term evolution of reliability and improving the real-time management of a power system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To derive cost-effective measures for CO2 mitigation, the authors of this paper develop a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for China's transport sector. Using the TIMES model, MAC curves are derived which identify the linkages among all transport modes, considering, among other uncertainties, the impacts of a carbon peaking policy and driver preferences for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The results underline that the intercity passenger transport sector has a cost advantage, with a huge potential for emissions reduction (accounting for almost 38.8% of all CO2 emissions mitigation). The freight sector is another potentially significant contributor to CO2 reduction, underlining its vital role for emission mitigation in the longer run. The carbon peak policy, while making alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) more efficient, is found to increase the overall cost of emissions reduction. A higher ratio of electricity to fossil fuel use by PHEVs drivers would help the transport sector to reduce CO2 much faster. The sensitivity analysis of these and other factors is also estimated in this paper. The final MAC curves provide valuable insights for future low-carbon energy development strategies of China's transport sector.},

Steel, aluminium and cement are the key manufacturing industries in India which provide inputs to various other sectors such as construction, transportation, power transmission, etc. As a result, their demand is consistently rising. These industries are heavily energy-intensive and use raw materials such as iron ore, coal, electricity, steam, and fuel oil, whose supply can act as severe production constraints over a period of time and can hinder sustainable development. Hence it becomes imperative for these industries to continuously innovate more energy efficient techniques. This paper makes a foray into the energy demand for these industries and explores the potential of any future reduction in their energy consumption. The paper offers a projection scenario for 2001-2031 (based on the MARKAL Modeling exercise for India) for possible catching up in reduction in energy consumptions in these sectors under alternative situations. The analysis suggests the existence of some plausible energy efficiency enhancing techniques in these industries. Exploring these options will definitely ensure cost effectiveness and competitiveness of these three key sectors in the global market. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The post-2012 climate policy framework needs a global commitment to deep greenhouse gas emission cuts. This paper analyzes reaching ambitious emission targets up to 2050, either - 10 % or - 50 % from 1990 levels, and how the economic burden from mitigation efforts could be equitably shared between countries. The scenarios indicate a large low-cost mitigation potential in electricity and industry, while reaching low emission levels in international transportation and agricultural emissions might prove difficult. The two effort sharing approaches, Triptych and Multistage, were compared in terms of equitability and coherence. Both approaches produced an equitable cost distribution between countries, with least developed countries having negative or low costs and more developed countries having higher costs. There is, however, no definitive solution on how the costs should be balanced equitably between countries. Triptych seems to be yet more coherent than other approaches, as it can better accommodate national circumstances. Last, challenges and possible hindrances to effective mitigation and equitable effort sharing are presented. The findings underline the significance of assumptions behind effort sharing on mitigation potentials and current emissions, the challenge of sharing the effort with uncertain future allowance prices and how inefficient markets might undermine the efficiency of a cap-and-trade system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To reinforce the long-term commitment to climate change mitigation, the post-2012 climate policy framework is aimed to be completed by 2009. The new agreement needs to include a wider participation of parties, and therefore needs to address the effort sharing of countries. The mitigation capabilities and the responsibilities of countries do however vary significantly. This can, in principle, be overcome with a cap-and-trade system, with which the question of equity is addressed trough the allocation of emission allowances. A number of effort sharing schemes have been proposed. Effort sharing however suffers from a fundamental trade-off between detail and transparency on how the emission allocations are calculated. This study addresses this problem by comparing and combining the results from a transparent but simplified effort sharing model EVOC, and a detailed and - due to its complexity - seemingly non-transparent ETSAP-TIAM energy system model. The aim of the study is to evaluate the goodness of the initial effort sharing, particularly in terms of mitigation costs experienced by different regions in the scenarios. Based on the long-term energy-climate scenarios crafted with the TIAM model, we assess the resulting consequences in emission profiles and the energy system, concentrating especially on regional mitigation costs and emission trading. Two cases of market failures in emission trading are also considered. Finally we compare the mitigation potentials between the two models and estimate the effect of EVOC recalibration on the national emission allowances. The results of the study underline particularly the importance of detailed and reliable assumptions for the mitigation potentials of different countries in the effort sharing process.

abstract = {This article analyses the implications of long-term low-carbon scenarios for the UK, and against these it assesses both the current status and the required scope of the UK energy policy. The scenarios are generated using the well-established MARKAL (acronym for MARKet ALlocation) UK energy systems model, which has already been extensively used for UK policy analysis and support. The scenarios incorporate different levels of ambition for carbon reduction, ranging from 40% to 90% cuts from 1990's level by the year 2050, to shed insights into the options for achieving the UK's current legally binding target of an 80% cut by the same date. The scenarios achieve their carbon reductions through very different combinations of demand reduction (implying behaviour change) and implementation of low-carbon and energy efficiency technologies on both the supply and demand sides. In all cases, however, the costs of achieving the reductions are relatively modest. The ensuing policy analysis suggests that while the cuts are feasible both technically and economically and while a number of new policies have been introduced in order to achieve them, it is not yet clear whether these policies will deliver the required combination of both short- and long-term technology deployment, and behaviour change for the UK Government's targets to be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2011 Earthscan.},

Readers should be aware that the cut-off date for information included was December 2012 and the report may not, therefore, reflect the situation at the time of reading. Phase 1 of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) facilitated the development of a state-of-the-art MARKAL model of the UK energy system. MARKAL is a well established linear optimisation, energy system model, developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) of the International Energy Agency (IEA) in the 1970s, and was until very recently used by it for its annual Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) reports. It is also used by many other research teams round the world, and has been regularly updated and improved over the years through the ETSAP Implementing Agreement. Towards the end of UKERC's Phase 1, in 2007-8, UK MARKAL was used for a major modelling exercise of different projections of the UK energy system to 2050, the results of which were published in Skea at al 2011. In the ensuing years, UK MARKAL was again used for major 2050-focused modelling projects: for the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) in 2010 (CCC 2010), for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in 2011 (HMG 2011), and again for UKERC to update the Energy 2050 scenarios in 2012.

The framework incorporates the interactions between agricultural and energy markets at the macro-level, and an assessment of production practices and environmental impacts at the micro (field)-level. For macro-level analysis, we use two existing modeling frameworks: the CARD U.S. agricultural markets model and the MARKAL energy systems model. The integrated modeling of agricultural and energy markets will be useful in analyzing a range of scenarios regarding the role of biomass feedstocks from the agricultural sector in an expanding market for biomass-based fuels and energy. Moreover, by linking the macro-level analysis to the micro-scale (field-level) analysis, we can represent shifts in farming practices, average productivity, and costs of production, as well as the environmental consequences of farmers' decisions resulting from the expansion of biomass feedstock production. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results of the analysis show that a hydrogen FCV would not be cost competitive until 2050 without a more severe carbon tax than the government's planned 2400 JPY/t-C carbon tax. However, as the carbon tax rate increases, instead of conventional vehicles including the gasoline hybrid electric vehicle, hydrogen FCVs gain market penetration earlier and more. By assuming a more severe carbon tax rate, such as 10 000 JPY/t-C, the market share of hydrogen FCVs approaches the governmental goal. This suggests that cheaper vehicle cost and hydrogen cost than those targeted in the roadmap should be attained or subsidies to hydrogen FCV and hydrogen refueling station will be necessary for achieving the goal of earlier market penetration. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

The first uses energy models to investigate the role of hydrogen in an energy and power market perspective, without considering hydrogen export. The second, uses an economic equilibrium model to examine the potential role of hydrogen export in value creation. The third analysis is a socio-technical case study on the drivers and barriers for hydrogen production in Norway. Main conclusions are that access to renewable power and hydrogen are prerequisites for decarbonization of transport and industrial sectors in Norway, and that hydrogen is a key to maintain a high level of economic activity. Structural changes in the economy, impacts of new technologies, and key enablers and barriers in this transition are discussed.},

Energy system modelling can provide crucial insights into the inherent uncertainty in such strategies, which needs to be understood when designing appropriate policy measures. This study contributes to the growing research area of uncertainty analysis in energy system models. We combine consistent and realistic narratives on several technology dimensions with a global sensitivity analysis in a national, bottom-up, optimizing energy system model. This produces structured insights into the impact of low-carbon technology and resource availability on the long-term development of the UK energy system under ambitious decarbonisation pathways. We explore a variety of result metrics to present policy-relevant results in a useful and concise manner. The results provide valuable information on the variability of fuel and technology use across the uncertainty space (e.g. a strong variation in natural gas demand). We demonstrate the complementarities and substitutability of technologies (e.g. the dependency of hydrogen technologies on the availability of CCS). We highlight critical low-carbon options and hedging strategies (e.g. the early decarbonisation of the electricity sector or the stronger use of renewable sources as a hedging against failure in other technologies) and demonstrate timing and path dependencies (e.g. the importance of early decarbonisation action in the presence of multiple technology uncertainty). The results also show how the availability of a given technology can have wider impacts elsewhere in the energy system, thus complicating the management of a long-term energy transition.},

Its methodological novelty is the incorporation of a process-oriented modelling approach based on a comprehensive technology database for the industry sector in a national energy system model for the UK (UKTM), allowing quantification of the role of both decarbonisation of upstream energy vectors and of mitigation options in the industrial sub-categories. This enhanced model is then applied in a comparative policy scenario analysis that explores various target dimensions on emission mitigation, renewable energy and energy efficiency at both a national and European level. The results show that ambitious emission cuts in the industry sector of up to 77% until 2050 compared to 2010 can be achieved. Moreover, with a reduction in industrial energy demand of up to 31% between 2010 and 2050, the sector is essential for achieving the overall efficiency commitments. The industry sector also makes a moderate contribution to the expansion of renewable energies mostly through the use of biomass for low-temperature heating services. However, additional sub-targets on renewable sources and energy efficiency need to be assessed critically, as they can significantly distort the cost-efficiency of the long-term mitigation pathway.},

In particular, the practicability of using "White Certificates" (energy efficiency) along the same lines as "Green Certificates" (renewable energy) was explored. Several of the policies and measures were simulated using technical-economic models of the MARKAL family. The results show that by 2020 it is possible to increase energy efficiency by 15% at no cost without taking externalities into account. If externalities are considered, an increase of 30-35% with respect to the business-as-usual scenario is justified. The wealth of information obtained through the models and analysis provides a set of recommendations for policy-makers, including: (1) the need for closer co-ordination between energy policies and environmental and climate policies; (2) the opportunity to establish more ambitious targets for energy efficiency; (3) the scope for increased EU co-ordination; (4) the extension of White Certificates to the medium and low energy-intensive industries; (5) the need to support White Certificates with accompanying actions, such as running information campaigns, promoting energy service companies, and providing dedicated credit lines; (6) the need to develop similar instruments for transport and (7) the continuing need for energy research and development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper delivers three main outcomes. First, we identify key criteria for analyzing current ESMs and we describe seven current and future low-carbon energy system modeling challenges: the increasing need for flexibility, further electrification, emergence of new technologies, technological learning and efficiency improvements, decentralization, macroeconomic interactions, and the role of social behavior in the energy system transition. These criteria are then translated into required modeling capabilities such as the need for hourly temporal resolution, sectoral coupling technologies (e.g., P2X), technological learning, flexibility technologies, stakeholder behavior, cross border trade, and linking with macroeconomic models. Second, a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps while clarifying high modeling capabilities of MARKAL, TIMES, REMix, PRIMES, and METIS. Third, to bridge major energy modeling gaps, two conceptual modeling suites are suggested, based on both optimization and simulation methodologies, in which the integrated ESM is hard-linked with a regional model and an energy market model and soft-linked with a macroeconomic model.},

abstract = {Against the background of the ambitious German targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, this paper investigates the economic potential for thermal load management with virtual power plants consisting of micro-cogeneration plants, heat pumps and thermal storage within the residential sector. An optimising energy system model of the electricity and residential heat supply in Germany is developed in the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL EFOM System) modelling framework and used to determine capacity developments and dispatch of electricity and residential heat generation technologies until 2050. The analysed scenarios differ with respect to the rate of technological development of heat and power devices, fuel and CO2 prices as well as renewable electricity expansion. Results show that high fuel prices and a high renewable electricity expansion favour heat pumps and insulation measures over micro-cogeneration, whereas lower fuel prices and lower renewable electricity expansion relatively favour the expansion of micro-cogeneration. In the former case heat pump capacities increase to around 67GWel, whereas in the latter case the total capacity of micro-cogeneration reaches 8GWel. With the aid of thermal storage, this provides considerable flexibility for electrical load shifting through heat pumps and electricity generation from micro-cogeneration in residential applications, needed for the integration of fluctuating renewable electricity technologies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

abstract = {It is of important practical significance to reduce NOx emission and CO2 emission in China's cement industry. This paper firstly identifies key factors that influence China's future cement demand, and then uses the Gompertz model to project China's future cement demand and production. Furthermore, the multi-pollutant abatement planning model (MAP) was developed based on the TIMES model to analyze the co-benefits of CO2 and NOx control in China's cement industry. During modeling analysis, three scenarios such as basic as usual scenario (BAU), moderately low carbon scenario (MLC), and radically low carbon scenario (RLC), were built according to different policy constraints and emission control goals. Moreover, the benefits of co-controlling NOx and CO2 emission in China's cement industry have been estimated. Finally, this paper proposes a cost-efficient, green, and low carbon development roadmap for the Chinese cement sector, and puts forwards countermeasures as follows: first, different ministries should enhance communication and coordination about how to promote the co-control of NOx and CO2 in cement industry. Second, co-control technology list should be issued timely for cement industry, and the R&D investment on new technologies and demonstration projects should be increased. Third, the phase-out of old cement capacity needs to be continued at policy level. Fourth, it is important to scientifically evaluate the relevant environmental impact and adverse motivation of ammonia production by NOx removal requirement in cement industry.},

This paper focuses on how cities formulate economic instruments and adopt carbon pricing experiments to support their climate objectives. Extensive literature is available on science-policy-making interface Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) and on the two mainstream approaches of carbon cost formulation—Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC). Although, the literature on how governments develop climate policy instruments, particularly towards a local carbon cost, is recent. We start by reviewing these essential concepts and tools for carbon cost formulation. We then critically review a set of local carbon pricing experiments, totaling fourteen international cities, and confirm a great demand for scientifically robust, verifiable, and transferable carbon cost methodologies at the local level. We thus propose an approach to assess the short-term technology cost of CO2 emission reduction in the mobility sector in Matosinhos municipality, Portugal. Our approach shows that a carbon cost methodology at the local level with robust, verifiable, and transferable results is possible. We advocate for a methodological advance to estimate versatile CO2 prices suitable for local conditions.},

How the transport sector evolve during the coming decades will have significant impact on the possibilities to meet tough climate and environmental targets.

Energy system optimisation models, like the TIMES modelling framework, are useful tools in identifying energy pathways to reach ambitious energy savings and emission mitigation targets. Based on the identification of urban transport-energy system characteristics, the needs of local governments, and insights from traditional transport models, we propose a partly new representation of the transport sector within a TIMES-City modelling framework, adapting it to the urban transport-energy setting to improve model realism and power of insight.

abstract = {The objective of this study is to improve evaluations of the future use of biomass sources in Sweden and France by representing the high spatial variations of the supply and cost of biomass sources in energy system models. The proposed methodology considers a high spatial disaggregation of biomass supply sources, as well as detailed biomass cost-supply curves, and is thereby able to account for spatial differences in heterogeneous land qualities, management strategies, and possible adaptation rates. Integrating the methodology into national or regional energy system models will enhance cost-effective evaluations of biomass sources as well as the development of the bioenergy sector. A TIMES energy system model was used to evaluate bioenergy production potential for France and Sweden based on domestic biomass sources and under the assumption that bioenergy production should not be at the expense of domestic food and forestry supply. Results show that by 2050, the biomass sources considered could provide as much as 250PJ of bioenergy in Sweden, and 1470PJ of bioenergy in France. Results further showed that 1st generation biofuels are likely to continue to play a substantial role in the biofuel mix. While 2nd generation biofuel production in Sweden is likely to be low, larger amounts of 2nd generation biofuels could be produced in France. However, the amount and type of 2nd generation biofuel produced in France was found to be highly dependent on the bioenergy demand level. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The development of scenarios to explore energy and low carbon futures has been widely applied. Although some studies combine qualitative scenarios with quantitative outcomes from modeling exercises, the two approaches have been extensively and separately used. Many energy scenarios are sustained only by the results of the models, which allow great technological details but neglect the interaction with social and economic factors. Using Portugal as a case study, this paper presents a framework to link socio-economic storylines, sustained by national stakeholders' workshops, with the development of quantitative energy scenarios through 2050, generated by the technology-based TIMES_PT model. The storylines highlight different visions of the country's development, including the energy system. A comparison between the energy profile from the storylines and the energy modeling outcomes was performed to assess the extent of their differences. This analysis revealed generally similar visions, with the exception of the importance of some technologies, which may affect future energy planning. We conclude that a combined method that links socio-economic storylines and energy modeling increases the robustness of energy scenario development because providing a coherent context for modeling assumptions allows better reasoning, which is most valued for the decision-making process.},

abstract = {Carbon capture, utilization and storage scenarios have been developed for the Lusitanian Basin (Portuguese region) under the STRATEGY CCUS project, considering Portugal's carbon neutrality goal up to 2050. Supported by the national energy policy vision, the scenarios assume the use of captured biogenic CO2 emissions to generate synthetic methane as well as the geological storage of fossil CO2. Although carbon capture, utilization and storage tackles CO2 emissions, while maintaining fuel combustion and industrial processes, the deployment of the technology may lead to side effects on the overall energy system, such as on renewable power generation necessary to produce synthetic fuels. This study analyses the spillover effects (i.e., the impacts) of carbon capture, utilization and storage in the Lusitanian Basin in the Portuguese energy system, namely in the national power capacity and final energy consumption. The analysis is supported by the linear optimization energy system model TIMES_PT. Results show that by 2050, the generation of synthetic methane by hydrogen from electrolysis and CO2 (e-gas) demands a large amount of green hydrogen, 29% more than compared with a cost-effective decarbonization scenario. Consequently, a higher installed power capacity of solar and wind (above 6 GW by 2050) will be required. Contrary to what would be expected, the mandatory generation of e-gas does not lead to a reduction in electricity consumption in final users, as the synthetic fuel substitutes instead biomass/biogas and the direct use of hydrogen.},

This paper describes the development of an integrated technological, economic modeling platform (HYBTEP), built through the soft-link between the bottom-up TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM system) and the CGE GEM-E3 models. HYBTEP combines cost minimizing energy technology choices with macroeconomic responses, which is essential for energy-climate policy assessment. HYBTEP advances on other hybrid tools by assuming 'full-form' models, integrating detailed and extensive technology data with disaggregated economic structure, and 'full-link', i.e., covering all economic sectors. Using Portugal as a case study, we examine three scenarios: (i) the current energy-climate policy, (ii) a CO2 tax, and (iii) renewable energy subsidy, with the objective of assessing the advantages of HYBTEP vis-{\`{a}}-vis bottom-up approach. Results show that the economic framework in HYBTEP partially offsets the increase or decrease in energy costs from the policy scenarios, while TIMES is very sensitive to energy services-price elasticities, setting a wide range of results. HYBTEP allows the computation of the economic impacts of policies in a technological detailed environment. The hybrid platform increases transparency of policy analysis by making explicit the mechanisms through which energy demand evolves, resulting in high confidence for decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The deep decarbonisation of the power sector coupled with electrification of end-use sectors will be crucial towards a carbon neutral economy, as required to achieve the Paris Agreement's goal. Several studies have highlighted the relevance of electrification under deep decarbonisation. However, previous work does not explore what would be the major shifts towards electrification, i.e., in what economic activities it will likely occur and when up to 2050 considering gradually stricter GHG emissions constraints. This is of upmost relevance since relatively small variations in emission caps may trigger substantial modifications in specific components of the energy system, namely the shift for the electrification of a particular energy end-use, with impacts on the power sector's portfolio. In this paper, we analyse the extension of the electrification of the energy system as a cost-effective strategy for deep decarbonisation. We set a large number of increasingly stringent mitigation caps to assess: (i) the degree of electrification of different energy end-uses across all economic activities, (ii) the impact in power sector portfolio and costs and (iii) investment needs. The novelty of this paper relies on the anticipation of electrification of activities traditionally supplied by non-electricity energy carriers, by exploring when and how such transformation may occur in the future, and how much it would cost. We assess the case of Portugal till 2050 by using the TIMES_PT model to generate 50 increasingly stricter decarbonisation scenarios. In the long term, incremental changes (+1%) in more aggressive decarbonisation targets (beyond −70% reduction) induce substantial increase in the share of electrification growth rates. Electric private vehicles, electricity-based steam and heat production in ceramic industrial sector and heat pumps in buildings are the most cost-effective electric technologies. We found that a decarbonisation up to near −80% of 1990′s levels of the Portuguese energy system does not have a significant impact on the power sector unit costs, and does not surpass historic values for some years. However, it should be noted that incremental changes (+1%) in more aggressive decarbonisation targets may increase sharply electricity costs in 2050 (+9%). Thus, focusing in only few scenarios may narrow the role of electrification (or other mitigation options) and its associated costs for deep decarbonisation. This paper allows researchers, planners and decision makers to enhance awareness regarding the relevance and cost-effectiveness of electrification under decarbonisation, namely its feasibility and affordability, providing fruitful insights.},

abstract = {Bottom-up and top-down models are used to support climate policies, to identify the options required to meet GHG abatement targets and to evaluate their economic impact. Some studies have shown that the GHG mitigation options provided by economic top-down and technological bottom-up models tend to vary. One reason for this is that these models tend to use different baseline scenarios. The bottom-up TIMES_PT and the top-down computable general equilibrium GEM-E3_PT models are examined using a common baseline scenario to calibrate them, and the extend of their different mitigation options and its relevant to domestic policy making are assessed. Three low-carbon scenarios for Portugal until 2050 are generated, each with different GHG reduction targets. Both models suggest close mitigation options and locate the largest mitigation potential to energy supply. However, the models suggest different mitigation options for the end-use sectors: GEM-E3_PT focuses more on energy efficiency, while TIMES_PT relies on decrease carbon intensity due to a shift to electricity. Although a common baseline scenario cannot be ignored, the models' inherent characteristics are the main factor for the different outcomes, thereby highlighting different mitigation options. Policy relevance The relevance of modelling tools used to support the design of domestic climate policies is assessed by evaluating the mitigation options suggested by a bottom-up and a top-down model. The different outcomes of each model are significant for climate policy design since each suggest different mitigation options like end-use energy efficiency and the promotion of low-carbon technologies. Policy makers should carefully select the modelling tool used to support their policies. The specific modelling structures of each model make them more appropriate to address certain policy questions than others. Using both modelling approaches for policy support can therefore bring added value and result in more robust climate policy design. Although the results are specific for Portugal, the insights provided by the analysis of both models can be extended to, and used in the climate policy decisions of, other countries. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Furthermore, total system costs are compared to a reference scenario. Existing analysis with TIAM shows different ways of reaching the 2 °C target (increase in global mean temperature) and also how uncertainty on different factors influences the optimal solution. The main conclusion from existing analysis with TIAM is that the 2 °C target is possible to reach, but it will be expensive. Another very important point is that if uncertainty on the value of the climate sensitivity (Cs) is taken into account then the optimal strategy calls for early action compared to a full foresight optimisation using the most probable value of Cs. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Provided that technologies alone could not solve the problem, we have integrated the sociological dimension, represented by the potentially powerful resource for energy conservation that exists in the ability of consumers to change their behaviour. This study aims at proposing a new MARKAL framework that would take into account consumers' technological improvements and behavioural changes minimizing carbon dioxide emissions and encouraging rational use of energy. As opposed to the traditional MARKAL framework based on technical and economic considerations, the SOMARKAL model integrates technological, economic and behavioural contributions to the environment. Essentially, the conceptual aspects of the SOMARKAL will be presented. Based on this new MARKAL formulation, we will simulate the possible contribution of awareness campaigns in triggering energy consumption behavioural changes and possibilities of technology switch, in the residential area of the city of Nyon (Switzerland), for the period 2005-2025, using ANSWER, the IEA's platform. The main focus is on lighting technologies. Three fictitious scenarios were produced, referring to three possible penetration rates of low consumption lighting technologies.},

For this, our model has been extended by disaggregating the agricultural demand sector into individual agri-food demands to allow for a more in-depth analysis. Besides a business-as-usual (baseline) scenario, we have constructed four different agri-food scenarios to assess the viability of reducing Canadian meat and dairy consumption in order to diminish Canada's agricultural sector energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our policy scenarios progressively restrict the consumption of different meat and dairy agricultural products until the year 2030. Our results suggest that the implementation of a meat and dairy consumption reduction policy would lead to a 10 to 40 % reduction in agricultural GHG emissions, depending on the severity of the scenario. This translates to a 1 to 3 % decrease in total Canadian GHG emissions by the year 2030. Besides these environmental benefits, health benefits associated with a reduction in meat and dairy consumption (as inferred from other studies) are presented as an additional source of motivation for implementing such a policy in Canada.},

Six scenarios were developed – reference case, NDC, global 2 °C and three scenarios where CO2 emissions of all model regions converged in 2050 based on criteria of GDP/capita, emissions intensity of GDP and per capita emissions. The analysis shows that emission rights allocation schemes influence the total energy system development costs, long-term electricity generation requirements, and share of renewables especially solar PV generation to meet the 2 °C target. The model runs also show that solar-PV is the single most important generation technology for decarbonisation of India's power sector. Limiting the share of solar-PV generation can lead to 20% reduction in total electricity generation and increase system costs substantially for 2050. Further, the results also indicate that India may have 200–215 GW of stranded coal generation assets in 2050 in the low carbon scenarios. Our analysis suggest that India is one of those countries which are at the development stage and also highly risked with the lock-in in carbon emitting infrastructure especially coal-based generations unless action taken in the near-term.},

abstract = {This paper contributes to the climate policy discussion by focusing on the challenges and opportunities of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 in Italy. To support Italian energy planning, we developed energy roadmaps towards national climate neutrality, consistent with the Paris Agreement objectives and the IPCC goal of limiting the increase in global surface temperature to 1.5◦ C. Starting from the Italian framework, these scenarios identify the correlations among the main pillars for the change of the energy paradigm towards net emissions by 2050. The energy scenarios were developed using TIMES-RSE, a partial equilibrium and technology-rich optimization model of the entire Italian energy system. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis was developed with the sMTISIM, a long-term simulator of power system and electricity markets. The results show that, to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the Italian energy system will have to experience profound transformations on multiple and strongly related dimensions. A predominantly renewable-based energy mix (at least 80–90% by 2050) is essential to decarbonize most of the final energy consumption. However, the strong increase of non-programmable renewable sources requires particular attention to new flexibility resources needed for the power system, such as Power-to-X. The green fuels produced from renewables via Power-to-X will be a vital energy source for those sectors where electrification faces technical and economic barriers. The paper's findings also confirm that the European “energy efficiency first” principle represents the very first step on the road to climate neutrality.},

abstract = {Fast-emerging (yet still relatively less developed) economies such as India are understandably cautious about committing to emissions reduction targets that could be economically costly. The tensions between continuing short-term economic growth whilst investing in low-carbon technologies for long-term decarbonisation could be eased if there were significant financial and non-climate potential benefits of decarbonisation for these economies. This study explores some of the potential benefits for India, by analysing its long-term mitigation options in the context of global action towards a 2°C target, using an energy systems model (The University College London TIMES Integrated Assessment Model, or TIAM-UCL) which represents India explicitly, as one of 16 global regions. The study finds that India could significantly over-achieve against a 2050 low-carbon target based on equal per capita emissions by 2050, at mitigation costs below the global carbon price, implying that it could earn significant revenues through selling international carbon credits, thereby offsetting some of the costs of decarbonisation. In addition, India would see much lower levels of fossil fuel consumption in a low-carbon scenario, thereby alleviating potential economic difficulties in securing access to adequate supplies of these fuels.},

This work has been carried out to ease the lack of National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) assessments at country level. The Spanish case has been used as illustrative of the European Union. The evolution of NOx and SO2 emissions has been analysed in depth using the TIMES-Spain energy optimisation model. The work has been structured into three parts. First, the implementation of the NECD and the consequences both on the evolution of NOx and SO2 emissions, and the electricity production mix; second, taxation on these pollutants has been modelled and discussed; and finally, the proposed "2013 EU Clean Air Package" ceilings to update NECD have been assessed. Results showed that meeting NECD targets would involve a high contribution of renewable sources to the electricity system, mainly wind and solar. In addition, NOx and SO2 taxation has been assessed. Results showed that taxes on pollutants led to lower emissions than using NECD. Hence, current ceilings are not strict enough to internalise all the environmental damages associated to those pollutants. In consequence, the suitability of the NECD has been discussed by means of the new ceilings included in the EU Clean Air Policy Package. Results showed that proposed reductions are insufficient to compensate the environmental damages especially in the short term.},

abstract = {During the past decade, the Spanish cement production industry has experienced constant technological updates. Nevertheless, meeting current and future environmental policy goals requires extra efforts. The Spanish case is significant because cement production went down dramatically due to the last economic crisis. This brought an important, but temporary, reduction of CO2 emissions. Therefore, there is an interesting opportunity for cement producers and policymakers to adjust the long-term targets. This work discusses the evolution of the cement industry in Spain from a realistic point of view using recent cement demand projections and the TIMES-Spain energy optimisation model. Several environmental-friendly options were implemented in TIMES-Spain following a literature review. These measures, aimed at contributing to the decrease of emissions to meet the established policy goals, include energy efficiency improvements, substitution scenarios (both for fuel and materials) and CO2 capture (post-combustion and oxyfuel). From a policy approach, the deployment of the EU ETS Directive entails that CO2 emissions from cement production will decrease by 8 Mt per year from 2030 with respect to the case without Directive. In a more technology-specific analysis, a remarkable decrease of 2-2.4 Mt CO2 was obtained in the material substitution scenario beyond 2030. Additionally, taking into account current projections for cement demand, CO2 capture technology does not emerge as a feasible option. Only if cement demand grew back to the pre-crisis level by 2050 and the CO2 emission allowances remained fixed would the CO2 capture via post-combustion start to be a reasonable alternative.},

abstract = {The selection of the social discount rate and the consideration of hurdle rates in energy systems optimisation models affect the creation of sound and comprehensive scenarios useful for energy modellers. Due to the lack of studies about the use of different discounting options in energy optimisation models, the goal of this paper is to fill that gap by establishing the foundations for a debate among energy modellers, policy-makers and stakeholders in this regard. So firstly, we introduced the concept of discount rates both social and technology-specific including a thorough literature review concerning figures, scopes and approaches. Secondly, two models, ETSAP-TIAM and TIMES-Norway, were used to assess the behaviour of the energy systems at different regionalisation levels, Europe and Norway respectively. Thirdly, we analysed the evolution of the electricity production mixes and system costs for both models and considering several values for the discount rates. Finally, results showed that the energy system is strongly affected by changes in the social discount rate. The lower the social discount rate is, the higher the renewable contribution. The social discounting exerts influence on capital intensive investments so it is quite important to look at the energy carriers pathways (fossil-renewable transition). This is what happens in the case of ETSAP-TIAM for Europe. Reversely, in the case of TIMES-Norway, as the electricity system is almost 100% renewable, it is important to take into account the hurdle rates of the technologies to enrich the competition by including their particular risks and barriers. In summary, we recommend using a value not higher than 4-5% for the social discount rate for the European countries as well as to include an exhaustive portfolio of hurdle rates for all the technologies included in the energy optimisation model.},

abstract = {This paper presents a set of prospective LCA studies of electricity production technologies of the Spanish mix from 2014 to 2050. The projection of the power system has been done by using the TIMES-Spain energy model, in which two prospective scenarios have been implemented, a Business as Usual (BaU) and other with a target of 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 with respect to 2005 levels. Accordingly, projections of ten LCA impact categories have been obtained. Concerning the evolution of the electricity mix, the coal power plants retirement by 2020 has been observed in both scenarios. The main differences befall on the natural gas contribution, higher in the BaU scenario than in 80% scenario and connected to the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants usage. In addition, LCA categories selected show overall reductions in the long term reaching from 21% in Ozone Depletion to 85% in Acidification in the BaU scenario, and from 56% in Ecosystems to 87% in Acidification in the 80% scenario. However, Abiotic Depletion potential grows up to 5-times by 2050 due to the metal requirements of the solar photovoltaic technologies, significantly present in the mix. Likewise, the analysis of the endpoint categories (Human Health and Ecosystems) concludes that their evolution is much affected by the presence of the natural gas CHPs and, furthermore, existing fossil options are the main cause of damage by far. Hence a fossil-renewable transition is needed in terms of sustainability. In summary, it is recommended to use energy systems modelling frameworks to develop comprehensive prospective LCA studies.},

Thus, life-cycle impacts are linked to the entrance of new wind turbines from 2014 to 2035 and, from then on, to the new hydropower run-of-river plants.},

abstract = {Various modeling studies analyzing global 2 °C climate stabilization scenarios have projected penetration of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies in India alongside a sizable penetration of renewable energy technologies. The assessments of geological storage potential over India have shown wide variation across regions. This paper examines the locations of large point sources of CO2 emissions in India and matches it with carbon storage locations to minimize the cost of CCS evolving grid. The concept of weighted Euclidean distance and Integrated Environmental Control Model are used to propose suitable pipeline networks for emissions-intensive clusters to optimize the cost of CO2 avoidance. The computational method estimates proximate storage location for each CO2 emitting source taking into account the total storage potential at each location. CCS requirement in India would vary depending on the global climate stabilization target. We examine two targets for India that correspond to 2 °C and well below 2 °C global mitigation regimes. According to our estimates, India could mitigate around 780 Mt CO2 per year below 60 $/t-CO2 (2005 prices) over 30 years, and another 250 Mt CO2 per year for up to 75 $/t-CO2 prices through CCS under these scenarios respectively.},

In this respect a number of initiatives and programmes (e.g. Covenant of Mayors, Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, CONCERTO, CIVITAS, etc.) have been set up in order to engage European cities in the effort towards a low carbon future and an improved quality of life through sustainable economic development. These initiatives have been generally successful and have resulted in the commitment of an increasing number of European cities towards sustainable development goals. At the same time, however, it has been revealed that there is a critical need for improved comprehensive city planning driven by an integrated and strategic approach, focused on cost benefit assessment towards sustainable energy use. This paper presents an innovative city planning approach developed within the EU FP7 project InSMART. It brings together four European municipalities - Evora (Portugal), Nottingham (UK), Trikala (Greece) and Cesena (Italy) -, academics, industries and technical consultants in order to establish a common methodology for enhancing sustainable planning for both the current and future city needs through an integrative and multidisciplinary approach. The methodology develops and employs a number of tools to assess the optimum mix of medium term measures (up to 2030) for a sustainable energy future, addressing the efficiency of energy flows across various city sectors with regards to economic, environmental and social criteria and paving the way towards actual implementation of priority actions. This paper presents the key concepts around this methodology and some selected results of the project (still ongoing). The results refer to the four city partners, all actively involved in developing a more sustainable energy system. Further on, the proposed approach may be replicable to other cities.},

Long-term energy system planning models overlook the impact of renewable intermittency on system operations due to the computational burden associated with large model size and long planning horizon. Hence, strategies such as soft-linking multiple models are developed, but they do not assure the convergence and optimality of such incoherent modeling framework. In this context, this paper utilizes unit commitment (UC) extension of TIMES modeling framework to integrate operational constraints directly in a long-term power system planning model. This strategy eliminates the complexity of handling multiple models. Results indicate that incorporation of UC constraints improve the performance of conventional generators in terms of increased capacity utilization, and help to assess flexibility requirements with high RESs. Energy storage provides the balancing and flexibility needs with stringent generator constraints. Sensitivity analysis shows that improved flexibility of thermal generators enables increased renewable penetrations.},

abstract = {Typically, energy system decarbonisation scenarios neglect the mitigation opportunities from reducing and restructuring energy service demands (ESDs), focusing instead on technology and fuel substitutions. Models tend to be designed to factor technologies explicitly while ESDs are exogenous. However, existing literature suggests that the scale and speed of decarbonisation required to limit global warming to 1.5∘ C by the end of the century requires a shift in energy demands to avoid the need for large-scale negative emission technologies. This can be brought about by major structural changes in drivers of demand such as transport modal shifting, substituting emission intensive materials like cement, and reducing building heat demand through behaviour change and efficiency. Ireland, the subject of this paper, has legislated one of the most ambitious decarbonisation targets in the world: the need to understand the role of demand shift is paramount. To fill this gap, the Irish Low Energy Demand (ILED) mitigation narrative is developed and applied to the TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM), an energy systems optimisation model. ILED represents a scenario where ESDs are decoupled from economic growth by shifting travel, increasing end-use efficiency, densifying urban settlement, focusing on low-energy intensive economic activities and changing social infrastructure. Compared to a scenario where ESDs follow ‘Business-as-usual' growth, ILED enables the achievement of steep decarbonisation targets with a less rapid energy system transformation, lower capital and marginal abatement costs, and with lower reliance on the deployment of novel technologies.},

The results were analyzed based on the final year CO2 emissions of the electricity system when compared to 1990 levels. The results show that when CO2 prices stay below 50€/tonne by 2050 there is no reduction in emitted CO2 emissions when compared to the levels of 1990. For CO2 prices reaching between 50 and 100€/tonne there is a clear reduction in CO2 with the increase in the price, from 7% with 50€/tonne to 79% with 100€/tonne. For prices above 100€/tonne the increased taxation has only a slight impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions, as even with a 300€/tonne price the CO2 reductions achieved are only of 87%. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Also, the predictions for CO2 emissions to the year of 2010 will be 45% above the defined limit. Applying TIMES model tool, this paper examines different scenarios regarding the price levels of CO2 taxes and trading under the Emissions Trading System in Europe and consider the perspectives of using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the scenario where the emissions licenses for CO2 credits are obtained for a price of 20 €/tonne of CO2 emitted, the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant will be the main thermal power plants in next three decades. After that period, the installed capacity of coal power plants will increase significantly from 2040 on and NGCC will almost vanish. In the scenarios where CCS was an option, the most significant conclusion is that above 50<€/tonne of CO2 emitted are the CCS technologies economically feasible, maintaining the predictions for electricity demand that show a slowly decrease after the year 2020. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Transport currently accounts for nearly half of global oil consumption and is the only field to be almost exclusively based upon a sole primary energy source. A possible evolution might be based on more oil-independent vehicles, on a higher use of energy efficient transport modes, on the integration of them through Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The answer to this partially global problem can be found both in transport and energy planning as well as in the adoption of new industrial and ICT technologies. Both energy strategy makers and transport planners need supporting tools for a better assessment of the impact of possible alternative policies and to set realistic targets for the transport sector. The present paper presents a conceptual link between two families of models - energy and transport - and provides some preliminary results of integrated modelling exercises for the Italian case, which show the importance of accurate ICT based data exchange between the models and the relevance of the comparison of present and future policy implementations.},

How far can countries ratchet up the mitigation ambition presented in the Nationally Determined Contributions? What is the magnitude of potential and necessary carbon dioxide removal, more particularly, biomass energy with carbon capture and storage? How can stranded assets be avoided? Is carbon neutrality achievable with technology innovation alone? These questions are at the core of the global, national and local energy systems modelling analyses in this book that explore the feasibility of roadmaps for a well below 2 °C future. The book is written by more than 20 teams of the IEA Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (IEA-ETSAP), a Technology Collaboration Programme supporting about 200 energy systems modelling teams from around 70 countries, which has operated for over 40 years. A key objective of IEA-ETSAP is to assist decision-makers in robustly developing, implementing and assessing the impact of energy and climate mitigation policies with the bottom-up techno-economic models of the MARKAL/TIMES family. This book constitutes a natural follow-up of the first book Informing Energy and Climate Policies Using Energy Systems Models, edited by IEA-ETSAP in 2015, prior to the Paris Agreement on climate change. The methodologies and case studies presented here illustrate how energy systems models have been and are being used to address complex energy and climate policy questions and provide critical insights into the feasibility of enhanced ambition. This responds directly to a requirement of the Paris Agreement and its Talanoa Dialogue to take stock of the collective efforts and determine how we can, all together, move the climate policy agenda forward and turn words into action.},

This paper proposes a framework for a harmonisation methodology with the definition of indispensable steps and recommendations to overcome stumbling blocks in order to reduce the variance of the outcomes which depends on controllable modelling assumptions. The harmonisation approach of the PARIS REINFORCE project is presented here to layout such a framework. A decomposition analysis of the harmonisation process is shown through 6 integrated assessment models (GCAM, ICES-XPS, MUSE, E3ME, GEMINI-E3, and TIAM). Results prove the potentials of the proposed framework to reduce the model variance and present a powerful diagnostic tool to feedback on the quality of the harmonisation itself.},

abstract = {The international literature has paid much attention to so-called 'fringe benefits' of greenhouse gas (GHG) policies. The concept is that GHG emission reduction in developing countries will also reduce local air pollution. On the basis of this concept, it is argued that it is possible to achieve simultaneously a reduction of local air pollution and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In reality, however, there is a sequence to the policy agenda. First the apparent local air pollution problems are tackled then the more distant greenhouse gas problem is considered. This sequence has consequences for the optimal policy selection. Moreover, most studies that focus on fringe benefits of GHG policies neglect the existence of cost-effective dedicated abatement technology for local air pollutants. This paper analyses the optimal set of policies for reduction of SO2, NOx and CO2 in Shanghai for the period of 2000-2020. The analysis is based on a linear programming MARKAL model for the Shanghai energy system. The results show that the relevance of no-regret options is limited because Shanghai has improved its energy efficiency significantly in recent years. The model calculations suggest that this trend will persist if current policies are sustained. This energy efficiency improvement and the planned introduction of natural gas have important benefits from a GHG emission point of view. These benefits have received little attention as yet. Local air pollution reduction can result in additional GHG emission reduction up to 2010. After 2010, however, its CO2 emission co-benefits are limited. Dedicated abatement technology is the most cost-effective way to reduce local air pollution. An additional incentive of 100 Yuan/t CO2 emission reduction (12.5 Euro/t) results in an additional emission reduction of 11% (22 Mt CO2), and it results in a significantly different technology mix than stand-alone local air pollution policies. The total potential for GHG emission reduction amounts to 66 Mt in 2010 and to 49 Mt in 2020 compared to base case levels without policies. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper discusses in assessment of the optimal use of biomass in Western Europe for the long term (2010-2030) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment is based on a linear programming model for the Western European energy and materials system, called MARKAL MATTER 4.2. The goal of the study was the comparison of the cost-effectiveness and the interactions between bioenergy, biomaterials and afforestation strategies in comparison to other greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies. The results suggest that the use of biomass for energy and materials applications will increase by up to 200 Mt (compared to the case with no permit price) if greenhouse gas policies are introduced. The main increase occures in the production of transportation fuels and substitution of petrochemical feedstocks and electricity generation from waste and residues. Afforestation offers a cost-effective competing land-use strategy. The total contribution of biomass strategies is an emission reduction of up to 400 Mt CO2 equivalents (9% of 1990 emissions). {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ireland imports 88% of its energy requirements. Oil makes up 59% of total final energy consumption (TFC). Import dependency, low fuel diversity and volatile prices leave Ireland vulnerable in terms of energy security. This work models energy security scenarios for Ireland using long term macroeconomic forecasts to 2050, with oil production and price scenarios from the International Monetary Fund, within the Irish TIMES energy systems model. The analysis focuses on developing a least cost optimum energy system for Ireland under scenarios of constrained oil supply (0.8% annual import growth, and -2% annual import decline) and subsequent sustained long term price shocks to oil and gas imports. The results point to gas becoming the dominant fuel source for Ireland, at 54% total final energy consumption in 2020, supplanting oil from reference projections of 57% to 10.8% TFC. In 2012, the cost of net oil imports stood at €3.6 billion (2.26% GDP). The modelled high oil and gas price scenarios show an additional annual cost in comparison to a reference of between €2.9bn and €7.5bn by 2020 (1.9-4.9% of GDP) to choose to develop a least cost energy system. Investment and ramifications for energy security are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Energy security is an interdisciplinary concept. Its definitions leaves it vulnerable to exploitation as a justification for energy policy instruments. The extensive literature has yet to converge to formulate a unified definition of energy security and many outline a multitude of methods of measurement, such as the Supply/Demand index applied here in modified form, but also the Hirshman-Herfindahl Index, the Shannon Index for fuel diversity, and others. However, many of these index methods do not explicitly take into account the techno-economic interdependencies which influence energy security within the energy system. This paper reviews the literature to establish an energy security assessment method considering perspectives from sovereignty, infrastructural robustness, and market resilience. The aim of the paper is to provide a transparent data rich method and assessment of energy security by means of an application of a systemic energy security index to historical data and potential projected techno-economic energy system scenario analysis for a decarbonising Irish Energy System.},

abstract = {In this paper, the strategic technology options, especially the potential role of natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants, in mitigation of CO 2 emission in electricity sector in China are assessed. We analyse the influence of different power generation technologies on CO 2 emission volume and abatement cost based on energy market and electricity demand prospects, and least-cost expansion of electricity generating system. In the latter model, we take into account electricity supply quality and CO 2 emission. The CO 2 abatement cost is estimated in a period of time rather than the traditional abatement cost estimation performed for a target year. The proposed model is applied to the case of Shanghai Municipality in China to assess potential role of natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants in mitigation of CO 2 emission. Impact of the baseline technology choice on CO 2 abatement cost is analysed through the formulation of three scenarios. For the first one ("Baseline" scenario), it is assumed that expansion of the electricity supply system is based only on coal-fired power plants; for the second scenario, it is supposed that the decision makers have already envisaged the use of natural gas combined cycle power plants (CCPP) in addition to coal fired ones; the third scenario mixes coal-fired, natural gas CCPP and nuclear power plants. It is found that on the horizon of the study (2020), maximum CO 2 emission mitigation potential of natural gas CCPPs can reach 42.4 million tons (MtCO 2), whereas maximum CO 2 emission reduction potential of nuclear power plants can be 298.2 MtCO 2. The CO 2 abatement cost estimation falls into the range from US$19/tCO 2 to US$51/tCO 2 depending on the level of imposed CO 2 penalty, volume of carbon emission reduction and baseline technology choice. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The role of energy storage and transmission under various assumptions about a) development of electric battery costs, b) transmission grid expansion restrictions, and c) the variability of future electricity demand is demonstrated. Two models are soft-linked – LIBEMOD, a multimarket energy equilibrium model of Europe, and TIMES-Europe, a bottom-up stochastic model of the European electricity and district heat sectors – to provide an analysis of the decarbonization of the electricity sector that has consistent assumptions about electricity use and fuel prices. To explicitly value flexibility, a stochastic methodology is used to ensure that investment decisions take into account different operational situations that can occur due to weather-dependent renewable generation and the uncertainty of the electricity demand. It is demonstrated that the European power sector can be decarbonised with a 65%–70% share of the electricity supply from wind power and PV in 2050. The cost-efficient investment in stationary batteries is highly dependent on technology development in PV and expansion of the international transmission grid.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been identified by several studies as a promising option in the greenhouse gas mitigation portfolio of different countries. Since the Iberian Peninsula is a region with a large availability of renewable energy sources (RES), the role of CCS deserves deeper analysis. Using the TIMES_IBERIA optimization model, this paper investigates the contribution of several factors (i.e. climate policy, RES and CCS cost curves, and gas prices) that might promote or constrain the adoption of CCS technologies as part of a portfolio for reducing CO2 emissions from the power generation and industrial sector, in the medium-long term (2020-2050), within the Iberian Peninsula energy system.CCS becomes cost effective only after mature renewables, namely wind onshore and hydropower, are fully exploited up to their technical-economic potential. An ambitious long term climate target (-50% reduction in 2050 over 1990) contributes to an early penetration of CCS (in 2025). It penetrates more in the power sector (60% of captured emissions) than in industry (40%), and most of it is implemented in Spain (95%), not in Portugal. CCS penetration appears very sensitive to the costs of CCS technologies, while much less sensitive to the costs of renewable technologies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Projections of energy demand are important for energy security supply and low carbon futures, and usually rely on final energy consumption trends methods, limiting the opportunity for future options. Methods supported by energy services are much preferred to estimate future energy demand, since they are better suited to accomplish end-users needs. Final energy can then be assessed through complementary tools, as technological models, resulting in deeper knowledge on the relation between energy services and technology options.This paper presents a bottom-up methodology to project detailed energy end-uses demand in the Portuguese residential buildings until 2050, aiming to identify the parameters governing energy services demand uncertainty, through a sensitivity analysis. The partial equilibrium TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model was used to assess technology options and final energy needs for the range of parameters variations for each end-use, allowing to conclude on the impact of uncertainty of energy services demand in final energy.Main results show that technology can overweight behavioral practices and lifestyle changes for some end-uses as in space heating and lighting. Nevertheless, important focus should be given to uncertain parameters related with consumer behavior, especially those on heating and other electric end-uses, as thermal comfort and equipment's use. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study aims at determining the technology combination that provides the lowest emissions and energy cost for the food-industrial sector. Using a linear optimization objective function in determining the least-cost pathway, data from various sources were compiled to perform simulations on two scenarios; a business as usual (BAU) case and an 80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Even in the base case, the emission level reaches 21% of 1990 levels; a reduction of 39% over the simulation period. This indicates that even without the imposition of GHG constraints on the food sector, it is economically more beneficial for the industry to migrate from fossil fuels. This migration takes place by replacing energy from LPG, LFO, Kerosene, HFO, Coal and Natural gas with biomass, biogas and CHP electricity. Economic benefits arise from the fact that biogas and biomass are produced from wastes which are generated onsite within food factories, hence the avoidance of purchasing energy feedstock from the market. The change in energy consumption between the two scenarios is similar due to the prevalence of least-cost solutions and similar energy and food demand requirements. However, the reduction in emissions are greater in the 80%-GHG case than the BAU case; 52% compared to 39% for the BAU case, for 2050 relative to 2010. This is largely owing to decarbonization of grid electricity. This study finds that the food-industrial sector has the potential to exceed this 80% reduction target to a value of 92%, due to the availability of onsite feedstocks to generate biogas. In this simulation, of all waste produced, 92% of waste feedstock is consumed in AD and CHPs, whilst the remaining 8% is dried and processed to be burned in biomass boilers.},

abstract = {Until now, the complex relationship between energy security and climate change has been addressed using a partial understanding of security, one that is based on simplified indicators such as import dependence or fuel mix diversity. As a consequence, the synergies and trade-offs between climate change and energy security policies have not been systematically explored according to a wider understanding of the latter concept. The purpose of this article is to resolve the resulting knowledge gap by proposing a theoretical approach to energy security that is consistent with its multi-dimensional nature, taking into account the whole energy supply chain. Five key 'systemic' properties of energy security will be identified - namely, stability, flexibility, adequacy, resilience and robustness. The paper proposes a novel framework to assess energy security and uses this framework to develop a comprehensive approach to the interactions between climate change policies and energy security. The impact of a low-carbon scenario on one of these five properties (long-term robustness) will be assessed using a complex multi-regional energy system model. The results demonstrate how this scenario induces structural changes along the whole energy supply chain, revealing dynamic vulnerabilities and trade-offs that are not adequately accounted for by existing indicator-based assessments. Finally, the paper provides solid foundations for further analysis of these trade-offs using more detailed sectoral models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Starting from the premise that shale gas resource size and production cost are two key preconditions for its development, our scenario analysis reveals the way these and other variables interact with the global energy system, impacting on the regional distribution of gas production, interregional gas trade, demand and prices. The analysis shows how the reciprocal effects of substitutions on both the supply and demand-side play an important role in constraining or enabling the penetration of shale gas into the energy mix. Moreover, we systematically demonstrate that the global potential for shale gas development is contingent on a large number of intervening variables that manifest themselves in different ways across regionally-distinct energy systems. A simple theoretical model is derived from the results of the scenario analysis.Its purpose is to simplify and explain the complex behaviour of the system, by illustrating the chain of actions and feedbacks induced by different shale gas economics, their magnitude, their relative importance, and the necessary conditions for the global potential to be realised. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The increase in the share of renewable energy in the power generation mix plays a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of power systems, thus facilitating the achievement of international and national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change. Due to the intermittent nature of variable renewable energy, the integration of these sources in power systems requires investments in additional solutions and setting strategies to ensure grid stability and reliability. For that purpose, a prospective modelling was applied to the relatively isolated island named Procida, located in the gulf of Naples in Italy, through the bottom-up optimization model TIMES-Procida for a long-term energy plan where technical solutions, i.e., deployment of photovoltaics on rooftops and storage, and policy scenarios, i.e., energy efficiency, were used to analyse the evolution of the energy system. The introduction of renewable energy could be much more relevant when dealing with islands; they appear as decisive territories for experimentation and analysis of the transformation of all power systems. At year 2050, our results address decarbonisation and energy autonomy. They show that only with high shares of renewable energy will the territory see a noticeable decarbonisation of its economic sectors (up to 24%) and a decreasing dependency on imports (−16.6% compared to low renewable integration). By comparing the results of scenarios including or lacking storage solutions, we showcased how this reflected on the investments in PV and on grid congestion relief.},

abstract = {The global trend is constantly increasing investments in strategic sectors of the economy, for example the electric power industry, which, in many countries, is becoming diversified and dispersed due to the multitude of entities investing in energy production and renewable resources, which leads to an increase in the heterogeneity of investment decisions. There is an urgent need to control the movement of investments, budget funds, as well as their development in the process of implementing investment programs of energy companies. The control of the movement of investments is the most promising direction of studying the subject of finance and audit. The increasing volume of public and private targeted investments in the energy sector and the lack of control over the effectiveness of investment projects (since each program contains several thousand lists of projects) necessitated the introduction of additional regulation of budget spending. The development of a mathematical apparatus for such regulation led to the creation in the Russian Federation of an institute of an independent public technological and price audit (TPA). The TPA is seen as a mechanism to ensure an effective project evaluation and selection process. This article describes methodological improvements using power system optimization models. The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) was developed as part of the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program of the IEA-ETSAP, an international community that uses long-term energy scenarios to conduct in-depth energy and environmental analyzes. This approach includes two different but complementary systematic approaches to energy modeling: an engineering approach and an economic approach. The same approach is used when conducting a TSA, when an investment object is evaluated as a set of technological and price parameters. The article considers a model of resource allocation in the energy sector and a mechanism for using TPA for investment projects with state participation in a natural monopoly. An approach to the financial and long-term distribution of investments of electric power companies based on the search for a balance of interests of the supplier and consumer and available energy sources is proposed. A model has been developed to find the optimal plan of technical solutions, taking into account the balance of the possibilities of the electric power industry and the needs of the economy. The relevance of the article is due to the requirements of investment efficiency, since the prevailing share in the costs is occupied by the costs of equipment and the construction of power plants.},

abstract = {The concept of 'grid parity' has emerged as a key indicator of the competitiveness of renewable electricity generation technologies. In this study, we firstly summarize the definition of the current levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) based methodology for the concept and address its limitation in not taking into account the systematic changes in an electric power system. Secondly, we introduce a bottom-up energy system model based methodology to overcome the limitation. Lastly, we apply the methodology to a case study, the grid parity analysis of solar photovoltaic and onshore wind technologies in the Korean electric power system, to highlight the differences between the results obtained using both methodologies. The results of the study show three implications. First, even if the LCOE of onshore wind is already lower than that of natural gas technologies and the average price of grid electricity, the LCOE is required to be much lower to achieve cost-competitiveness in the electric power system. Second, different technologies might be required to have different LCOE levels to be cost-competitive in the same power system. Third, a policy or plan for the deployment of renewable energy technologies must be harmonized with other policies and plans within the same system.},

As these production modes have a lower energy density, their development will imply an increase in the amount of land dedicated to electricity production. This study investigates the links between an optimal decarbonization of the electricity system, land requirements, and the development strategy of interconnections. We study these interactions using eTIMES-EU, an energy system optimization model, by endogenously taking into account a land variable and testing two interconnection development plans. Our results show that it is possible to limit the land use of the network to its 2020 value for roughly a one percent higher total discounted cost, and that the development of interconnections changes the technologies to be installed on a European scale, but that it requires efficient and ambitious planning. Moreover, our results highlight disparities across countries in terms of space and investment that may constitute barriers to implementing this type of centralized development policy.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the long-term prospects of alternative fuels in global personal transport. It aims at assessing key drivers and key bottlenecks for their deployment, focusing particularly on the role of biofuels and hydrogen in meeting climate policy objectives. The analysis is pursued using the Global Multi-regional MARKAL model (GMM), a perfect foresight "bottom-up" model of the global energy system with a detailed representation of alternative fuel chains, linked to the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC). The analysis shows that biofuels are limited by the regional availability of low-cost biomass, but can be important for meeting mild climate policy targets. If policy-makers intend to pursue more stringent climate policy, then hydrogen becomes a competitive option. However, the analysis finds that the use of hydrogen in personal transport is restricted to very stringent climate policy, as only such policy provides enough incentive to build up the required delivery infrastructure. An analysis of costs additionally shows that "keeping the hydrogen option open" does not take considerable investments compared to the investment needs in the power sector within the next decades, but allows the use of hydrogen for the pursuit of stringent climate policy in the second half of the century. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Paris Agreement, entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain the global average temperature raising below 2°C, countries that have ratified the agreement should declare their contribution to reducing GHG emissions. one of the most important components contributing to global GHG emissions is the transportation sector. The GHG emission from the transportation sector is 84.7 Mton CO2eq. which accounts for 16% of the total GHG emissions throughout Turkey in 2017. Road transportation with a rate of 93%, corresponds to the biggest share of GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the current study, GHG emissions were modelled from 2016 to 2050, in order to assess the impacts of the transportation sector on climate change in Istanbul, which is the most populous city and has the highest number of vehicles in Turkey. Istanbul has a major importance for Turkey, from the point of its energy consumption and climate-related emissions. For this purpose, the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) as a technology-rich and economic model was used. The results of the study were obtained for the reference scenario, which assumes that the existing plans and policies will continue until 2050. Furthermore, three alternative scenarios were studied which are related to electric rail transportation (Scenario 1), electric and hybrid cars (Scenario 2) and limited CO2 emissions (Scenario 3). Results show that the total GHG reduction is 1.1% Scenario 1, 11% for Scenario 2 and 39% for Scenario 3 in 2050. In the third scenario where the emission limitation was introduced to the model, there was a trend towards vehicles with higher amounts of LPG and CNG to keep the emission at the desired level, and fuel consumption was approximately 5.5% higher than the reference scenario in 2050.},

abstract = {Integrated assessment models are generally not constrained by raw materials supply. In this article, the interactions between a wide diffusion of electric vehicles in the world transportation sector and the lithium supply are analysed in the Times Integrated Assessment Model (TIAM-IFPEN version). The lithium sector and a detailed representation of the transportation sector have been then implemented into the TIAM-IFPEN processes constituting the global energy system. Hence, the availability of this strategic material to supply the growing demand for low-carbon technologies in the context of the energy transition can be questioned. Incorporating an endogenous representation of the lithium supply chain allows investigating its dynamic criticality depending on several optimal technology paths that represent different climate and/or mobility scenarios between 2005 and 2050. It is the first detailed global bottom-up energy model with an endogenous disaggregated raw materials supply chain. Based on our simulations, the geological, geopolitical and economic dimensions of criticality are discussed. Four scenarios have been run: two climate scenarios (4 °C and 2 °C) with two shapes of mobility each: a high mobility where we consider the impact of urban dispersal with a huge car dependence/usage, and a low mobility in which the demand for individual road transport is lower due to a more sustainable urban planning and more public transport. The electric vehicles fleet should reach up to 1/3 of global fleet by 2050 in the 4 °C scenarios, while it could be up to 3/4 in the 2 °C scenarios both with high mobility, mostly located in Asian countries (China, India and other developing countries in Asia) due to the large presence of 2 and 3-wheelers. The penetration of electric vehicles has a major impact on lithium market. The cumulated demand over the period 2005–2050 reaches up to 53% of the current resources in the 2 °C scenario with a high mobility. These results tend to show an absence of geological criticality. Nevertheless, they have clearly highlighted other different forms of vulnerabilities, whether economic, industrial, geopolitical or environmental. A discussion about the future risk factors on the lithium market is done at a regional scale aiming at analysing more in-depth the impact of the electric vehicle on lithium market. Our study of this particular strategic material shows that the model could be a useful decision-making tool for assessing future raw material market in the context of the energy transition and could be extended to other critical raw materials for more efficient regional and sectorial screening.},

The TIMES-DK model was further developed to concurrently represent all emerging transport technologies (ETTs) in road- and off-road transport applications, disaggregated transport technologies and service demands segmentation to capture consumers preferences and heterogeneity, and to endogenise fuel infrastructures. The model runs optimise the societal surplus in between 2010 and 2050. There is a particular focus on the role of gas in transport. The results reveal that in between 2020 and 2040, natural gas (NG) could cost-efficiently serve as a transition fuel. Decarbonisation pace and fuel infrastructure assumptions were found to have a large impact on the NG adoption levels. This study showed that the combined use of liquid biofuels (mainly biomethanol), upgraded biogas, electricity, and hydrogen fuels would deliver cost-effective deep decarbonisation by 2050; however, their various decarbonisation roles vary within and across transport segments. Depending on the decarbonisation pace, a marginal CO2 abatement cost of 419–549 €/ton (or 1–1.29 €/L gasoline) is required by 2050 in Denmark. The results also showed that 25% and 30% cost reductions of BEVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), compared to our central cost assumptions, would increase their respective adoption by 36% and 66% towards 2050. They show high market shares particularly in the medium size segment than in the small and large segments. Competition for limited biomass resources coupled with higher fuel demand results in adoption of ETTs.},

The Hinn{\o}ya island in Norway is used as a use case. Three distinctive off-grid and grid-based alternative power supply solutions were proposed and studied as a replacement to the existing diesel power solution in a three-stage stochastic model and under two critical long-term uncertainties: (1) access to strong grid and (2) storage battery cost. The TIMES modelling framework is applied. The stochastic model results reveal that grid integrated storage is an optimal near-term investment for a storage battery cost of 295 €/kWh and less by 2025. In scenarios with no access to strong grid, grid integrated storage continues to be a least-cost solution in the long-term as well, whereas in those scenarios with strong grid access, new investment in storage is not required after 2030. Contrary to the stochastic model runs, the equivalent deterministic model runs showed that a hybrid wind and diesel solution is an optimal near-term investment. From 2030, however, a similar technology pattern in both stochastic and deterministic model runs are observed. Nevertheless, the results are very sensitive to the assumed storage battery costs. Higher storage costs (as high as 704 €/kWh by 2025) would make the hybrid wind and diesel solution an optimal solution instead of the grid integrated storage solution in near-term investment in both stochastic and deterministic model runs.},

Since electricity consumption forms about a fifth of the total energy consumption, and directly impacts the country's economy and people's well-being, it is necessary to pay emphasis on Malaysia's long-term power sector planning by identifying sustainable options which will enhance Malaysia's energy security and mitigate climate change. This paper presents an analysis of the long-term power generation options for Malaysia by deploying the integrated MARKAL-EFOM system (TIMES) model. The examined scenarios are business as usual (BAU) and optimized least cost scenarios which include: existing technology, plus renewable, plus nuclear as well as, plus photovoltaic (PV) and storage. The results indicated that Malaysia has sufficient renewable energy resources to meet the projected electricity demand by 2050 and fossil fuels can be fully replaced with electricity sourced from large hydropower and combination of other indigenous sustainable energy sources. The variability issue of renewables can be stabilized with the integration of storage systems into the grid. This analysis also demonstrated that installation of 8.57 GW solar PV panels on existing rooftops combined with 3.6 GW large-scale pumped heat energy storage (PHES) system can generate electricity comparable to a 2.0 GW nuclear plant at a lower system cost of $102.4 billion. Hence, if Malaysia were to adopt a sustainable policy, then nuclear power would not be an ideal option as uranium fuel relies on continuous imports.},

An economic assessment on two baseload power plants is included to evaluate the investment viability. The results indicated that the BAU and NUC2 scenario are unsustainable as the dependency on fossil fuel for electrical power generation by 2050 is still high at 71.92% and 66.83% respectively. Contrariwise, the RNW6S7 scenario revealed a low carbon profile for power generation in Malaysia by 2050, whereby the emissions have declined to a minimum level of 11,490 kt which is equivalent to 92.45% of avoided CO2 in contrast to the BAU levels. The low carbon state is attained due to 98.37% of the generation output is renewable electricity. Finally, the RNW6S7 scenario demonstrated that the CO2 emissions in 2030 will drop by 46.22% relative to the 2005 levels which from the power sector perspective surpassed the Paris Agreement targets.},

A list of all referenced models is presented and the literature is analysed with regards sectoral coverage and technological inclusion, as well as mathematical structure of models.The paper compares available models using an appropriate classification schema, the introduction of which is aimed at making the model landscape more accessible and perspicuous, thereby enhancing the diversity of models within use. The distinct classification presented in this paper comprises three sections, which specify the model purpose and structure, technological detail and mathematical approach. The schema is not designed to be comprehensive, but rather to be a broad classification with pertinent level of information required to differentiate between models.As an example, the UK model landscape is considered and 22 models are classified in three tables, as per the proposed schema.},

Population growth and sustained economic growth will make India to one of the biggest economies in the world, consuming huge amounts of energy. The study shows that India would consume in 2100 a third of the global electricity demand of 2000. If no intervention are considered, coal will keep its position as dominant source in the electricity sector throughout the whole 21st century. This would result in tremendous CO2 emissions. The picture changes completely, if stringent restrictions on CO2 emissions are applied. In the case of strict emission reductions new technologies like fusion could make an inroad to the Indian energy system.

As part of the PPCS (Power Plant Conceptual Study) in Europe, published in 2005, an assessment was made of the likely economic performance of the range of fusion power plant concepts studied. Since that time, new work has been carried out, within the fusion programme, and particularly in the EU DEMO study, that changes a number of the important assumptions made in the PPCS. These changes allow either reduced cost versions of the PPCS plant models or, alternatively, plants with less ambitious technical assumptions at constant cost. The impact of the new results, emerging from the EU DEMO studies, on the role of fusion in the future energy market is described. A new energy economics model is employed to analyse the potential market performance of fusion power in a range of future energy scenarios and this shows that there can be a significant role for fusion in a future energy market. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {This study provides a review of the emergence of hydrogen within low-carbon pathways from different integrated energy system models. The objective is to understand the drivers and policy scenarios that lead to the emergence of hydrogen over other low-carbon technologies. The review is divided into global, multi-regional and national integrated energy system models with drivers, marginal abatement costs and timing of hydrogen emergence assessed. Hydrogen's use in energy systems is complex as a result of its relationship with other energy sources. It was found that bioenergy can act as both a competitor and driver for hydrogen energy, along with increased electrification and high renewable electricity scenarios. However, electric vehicles are a main competitor in the passenger vehicle sector. In reviewed results, hydrogen mainly emerges after 2030; although, some technologies emerge as early as 2020 and as late as 2050. The uncertainty and complexity surrounding hydrogen may be as a result of the difficulty of representing hydrogen technologies and systems in energy system models. This study can allow policy makers to assess the various options to be considered regarding hydrogen and make informed decisions for moving towards a decarbonised energy system.},

This target has been set at a minimum of 80% reduction relative to 1990 levels, to be achieved by 2050. The Act also creates the need to set a series of carbon budgets, which chart the course to achieving the long term 2050 targets via a series of intermediate steps. This report forms part of the evidence base to support government decisions relating to the 4 th carbon budget period, which runs from 2023 to 2027. The investigation presented draws on the MARKAL model of the UK energy system. The MARKAL approach is a widely recognised and internationally supported model that allows the investigator to consider ideal pathways for energy system change, under decarbonisation constraints, in a technology-rich framework with sound economic basis. MARKAL finds the pathway of energy system change that maximises combined consumer and producer surplus, via consideration of technologies, conservation measures, upstream resources, and the reaction of consumers to changes in energy price. The UK MARKAL database contains more than 1,000 resources, conversion technologies and end-use technologies, all of which are considered by the model in choosing the " best " combination of measures and timing of their implementation to achieve the required abatement.},

abstract = {Estimates of the magnitude of CO2 emissions reduction brought about by an intervention in the energy system are important because they signal which interventions are the most potent in terms of climate change mitigation. Yet quantifying emissions changes is not trivial because interventions act on the margin of the energy system, rather than acting on all components of the whole energy system equally. Therefore, in order to accurately attribute outcomes to interventions, the specific energy system changes precipitated by the intervention should be estimated, along with the corresponding change in emissions. This paper builds on previous research in this regard estimating short-run marginal emissions factors in national electricity systems. It presents the concept of the long-run marginal emissions factor (LR-MEF), and builds and applies a new electricity system model to study the problem. For the British electricity system it is found that the average LR-MEF is approximately 0.26-0.53kgCO2/kWh for the coming decade, but this reduces to approximately zero by 2035 and onwards as the system decarbonises. Furthermore, it is found that the LR-MEF can diverge very significantly from the short-run. This highlights the state of flux of the British electricity system and the importance of taking structural changes in the electricity system into account when attributing emissions reduction to interventions. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

Four setups where a bottom-up linear programming model is hard-linked with a top-down computable general equilibrium model are implemented. A solution is found by iterating between the two models, until convergence is reached. The same equilibrium solution is found by all hard-linked setups in all problem instances. Next, one integrated model is introduced by extending the computable general equilibrium mixed complementarity model with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that represent the bottom-up linear programming model. This integrated model provides the same solutions as the hard-linked models. Also, an alternative integrated model is provided, where the bottom-up model objective is optimized while the top-down model is included as additional constraints. This nonlinear program corresponds to a multi-follower bilevel formulation, with the energy system model as the leader and the general equilibrium players (firms and household) as followers. The Stackelberg equilibrium from this bilevel formulation pareto-dominates the Nash equilibrium from the other model setups in some problem instances, and is identical in the remaining problem instances. Different ways to couple the mathematical models may result in different solutions, because the coupling represents different real-world situations.},

A TIMES model for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator footprint using publicly available data was used to examine system integration costs and emissions savings benefits of high penetration of intermittent renewable electricity. TIMES is a bottom-up optimization model that minimizes the total system cost. The number of time slices was increased to capture wind and solar generation dynamics, to better understand spinning reserves costs, and to allow battery storage. Using candidate sites for solar and wind generation, transmission, investment and production costs were added. Total system costs increased as there were higher transmission and spinning reserve costs. The emissions savings of Carbon Dioxide equivalent, Sulphur Dioxide, and Particulate Matter were converted to economic benefits using the Social Costs of Emissions. As the penetration of wind and solar generation increases, emissions savings and economic benefits increase. The system integration costs are greater than the benefits of emissions savings. The economic benefits do not justify the system integration cost increases.},

Building on established emissions reduction scenarios, a financial model is developed from an integrated energy system model to understand the financial risks associated with continued investment in gas networks.

To capture feedbacks from impacted natural or socio-economic systems requires interactive two-way coupling, but this is generally computationally infeasible with even moderately complex general circulation models (GCMs). Dimension reduction using emulation is one solution to this problem, demonstrated here with the GCM PLASIM-ENTS (Planet Simulator coupled with the efficient numerical terrestrial scheme). Our approach generates temporally evolving spatial patterns of climate variables, considering multiple modes of variability in order to capture non-linear feedbacks. The emulator provides a 188-member ensemble of decadally and spatially resolved (∼ 5° resolution) seasonal climate data in response to an arbitrary future CO2 concentration and non-CO 2 radiative forcing scenario. We present the PLASIM-ENTS coupled model, the construction of its emulator from an ensemble of transient future simulations, an application of the emulator methodology to produce heating and cooling degree-day projections, the validation of the simulator (with respect to empirical data) and the validation of the emulator (with respect to high-complexity models).

In this analysis, a bottom-up energy system model for the residential heating sector has been built with the model generator TIMES and expanded by findings on consumer behaviour. The model is used to investigate the effect of consumer behaviour on residential space heating demand in Austria from 2007 to 2030, and to quantify the implications on possible future energy savings. Model results show that (1) energy demand for residential heating is slightly decreasing, (2) consumer behaviour greatly affects energy demand, (3) neglecting consumer behaviour leads to a significant overestimation of possible energy savings due to building-standard improvement. This analysis provides a better understanding of the interaction between thermal improvements of buildings and consumer behaviour and enables better founded outlooks on possible future energy savings.},

Alternative policies on CO 2 emission constraints reduce the burden of imported fuel, improve energy security and reduce environmental impacts. The results show that the introduction of the CO 2 emission reduction targets and carbon tax directly affect the shift of technologies from high carbon content fossil-based to low carbon content fossil-based and clean solar PV technologies compared to the base scenario. The cumulative net energy imports during 2005-2035 would be reduced in the range of 33-61% compared to the base scenario. The total primary energy requirement would be reduced in the range of 4.5-22.37% and the primary energy supply system would be diversified. Solar PV plays an important role in achieving reasonable energy security. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The authors propose an alternative, investment-led approach to analysing the potential for the development of hydrogen energy in the UK. The UK economy is relatively sensitive to movements in world fossil fuels markets since the energy sector contributes at least 5% of UK GDP and represents an asset pool of at least {\pounds}230 billion. Much of the ongoing research to assess possible scenarios for the development of alternatives to existing energy systems, including hydrogen energy, in the UK is built around the cost-optimising MARKAL model. The authors believe that this approach offers an incomplete picture of hydrogen energy deployment since it ignores the mechanisms dictating the flow of commercial capital to the sector and they suggest an alternative model based on the risk-adjusted value proposition. Initial analysis shows that valuation differentials already exist between companies in the fossil fuel, utilities and fuel cell sectors and that this might be exploited to the advantage of investors thus affecting the speed of development in hydrogen energy. It should be noted that the following represents work in progress and the authors intend to publish an extended analysis in due course. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

abstract = {Historically, land use in Britain has been shaped by the environment's capacity to provide energy as well as food, water and shelter. Over the next decades, energy will again become a major driver in land cover change as we seek to capture the necessary energy to replace fossil fuels, reduce environmental damage and substitute for insecure supplies. Britain was one of the first places to exploit fossil fuels extensively, initially coal, and it has the potential to generate considerable amounts of renewable energy from tides, waves, the wind, biomass and sunlight. The UK Government's policy is to develop a suite of technologies that will provide a resilient supply without compromising its economy or its international commitments to environmental protection. This paper examines the three major terrestrial options for renewable energy and assesses each by successively filtering them for feasibility, achievability and practicality incorporating existing developments, designation and public opinion. Technology and opinion are dynamic, so the outputs need to be viewed as indicative of alternative scenarios rather than as fixed forecasts. Implications for changes in the energy supply infrastructure needed to match the new supply chains are highlighted. The demand for energy depends on the demographic profile (population size, age distribution, lifestyle and expectations) and on economic activity. Here total demand is predicted using the UK Energy Research Centre's Energy 2050 model, which uses linear programming to balance economics and environmental capacity by major demand sectors in five-year time steps. The core model often generates challenging results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.},

abstract = {This paper approximates the emissions rebound effects. 1As per Binswanger (2001), we take the " rebound effect" to be defined in broad terms. In this paper we refer generally to the " emissions rebound" It is taken to mean the increase in emissions due to the introduction of some measure which is lower in cost and emissions than business as usual practice. associated with substituting expensive and GHG emitting natural gas (LNG) power plants, with apparently cheaper and lower emitting nuclear plant. It then evaluates the effect this has on economy wide electricity use as well as net GHG emissions changes.The analysis is undertaken by combining aspects of an input-output model with an optimizing energy systems model.The scope of the case study is limited to the effects of the electricity sector (and its emissions) on the Korean economy from 2005 to 2030. Its primary basis (in terms of data and assumptions) is the recent national Basic Plan for Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand (KPX, 2006).2That work extends only to 2020, but for this effort is extrapolated using consistent assumptions to 2030. KPX (2006) describes a national power expansion plan developed by the Korea Power exchange and does not include any specific technology focus. The cases considered a limited increase of the share of Advanced Pressurised Reactor (APR) nuclear plant at the expense of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant running on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG).Three scenarios are studied, based on KPX (2006). These include (1) a Reference scenario,. 3The reference case is not the least cost case in a pure sense: as determined by the KPX (2006) planning process, it is the least cost case subject to a political (neither economic nor technical) constraint on upper limit of nuclear power. In related work, a soft technical limit-which is significantly higher-is estimated (IAEA, 2006a,b). It is also entirely possible that site considerations may force another technical limit which is not considered here. Current work indicates that sites have been identified for the next ten nuclear power plants, see: OPR 1000 (2008) and APR 1400 (2008), with investigation for further sites or site expansion currently taking place. (2) a Mitigation scenario (where an extra 5000. MW of nuclear is allowed to enter the system at the expense of LNG plant, but no emissions rebound is calculated) and (3) a Mitigation+rebound scenario (where some emissions savings of the extra nuclear plant are offset by an emissions rebound).4Using the IO-Optimization model developed, a feedback mechanism is introduced. This would invoke the use of offsetting GHG emitting technologies, if for some reason (directly and indirectly), the effect of the increased introduction of nuclear power was to increase the demand for electricity. To achieve this, there is a limit placed on the introduction of new nuclear. If that nuclear power is introduced (to its limit) and demand for electricity increases it must be met by other power plants. In the Korean system, the other power plants that are economic in our scenarios are CO2 emitting fossil plant. Interestingly while our limit is arbitrary and conservative, there are technical limits associated with the characteristics of the power system which would limit nuclear, albeit at a higher level of about 60% of total generation (IAEA, 2006b).The modelling approach developed is useful as it provides a method of including and indicating some economic interactions with the energy system in a relatively transparent manner. Stand alone economic models can lack energy system dynamics, while energy systems model are often decoupled from detailed economic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 IAEA.},

It describes the model's formulation in terms of a 'plain English' description, algebraic formulation, implementation-in terms of its full source code, as well as a detailed description of the model inputs, parameters, and outputs. A key feature of the OSeMOSYS implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of OSeMOSYS and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the OSeMOSYS community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the LEAP model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The effect of multi-pollutant regulations such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) upon these decisions and costs is also considered.We use decision trees to structure the problem, defining multiple futures for each uncertainty and then simulating how the U.S. energy market responds to them. A two-stage stochastic version of the energy-economy model MARKAL simulates the market. Relative importance of the uncertainties is assessed using two indices: expected cost of ignoring uncertainty (ECIU) and expected value of perfect information (EVPI). We also calculate the value of policy coordination (VPC), the cost saved by avoiding surprise changes in policy. An example shows how a stochastic program can be used to compute these indices. The analysis shows that the possibility of greenhouse gas regulation is the most important uncertainty by these measures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Unlike previous research of green utilization behavior, this study established a dynamic adjustment mechanism for the government's subsidy policy for electric vehicles through the case study of Taiwan's electric motorcycle, so that the government's finite budget can be effectively allocated. Results indicate that emerging energy technologies reach the market competition conditions of economies of scale through government subsidy, subsidy policies should gradually phase out the market and transfer finite budgets to other emerging energy technologies that need to break through economies of scale. Therefore, the incentives phase-out mechanism of the electric motorcycle in this study will be helpful in the decision-making thinking of government and quantitative evaluation for the promotion of emerging energy technologies in the future.},

abstract = {Low-carbon power generation technologies such as wind, solar and carbon capture and storage are expected to play major roles in a decarbonized world. However, currently high cost may weaken the competitiveness of these technologies. One important cost reduction mechanism is the “learning by doing”, through which cumulative deployment results in technology costs decline. In this paper, a 14-region global energy system model (Global TIMES model) is applied to assess the impacts of technology diffusion on power generation portfolio and CO2 emission paths out to the year 2050. This analysis introduces three different technology learning approaches, namely standard endogenous learning, multiregional learning and multi-cluster learning. Four types of low-carbon power generation technologies (wind, solar, coal-fired and gas-fired CCS) undergo endogenous technology learning. The modelling results show that: (1) technology diffusion can effectively reduce the long-term abatement costs and the welfare losses caused by carbon emission mitigation; (2) from the perspective of global optimization, developed countries should take the lead in low-carbon technologies' deployment; and (3) the establishment of an effective mechanism for technology diffusion across boundaries can enhance the capability and willingness of developing countries to cut down their CO2 emission.},

This paper undertakes a methodological review of a selection of UK and international low carbon scenario studies, using a typology of 'trend based', 'technical feasibility' and 'modelling' studies. Dominant methodologies in such studies have been the 2 × 2 axis and the 'back-casting' approach. Strengths of the studies reviewed include technological detail, and identification of key economic and social constraints. Weaknesses include the over-reliance on constructs such as exogenous emissions constraints, and high level trends, which diminish the ability to understand how the various future scenarios could be brought about or avoided. This is compounded by the lack of depiction of specific system actors; the tendency to abstract policy from the scenarios; and the resulting failure to consider policy, technology and behaviour in an iterative, 'co-evolving' fashion. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, controversial issues have emerged, especially on avoided GHG emissions, raising uncertainties regarding its future development. For an actor, investing in the appropriate pathway is yet not straightforward as resource availability, process efficiency and costs are uncertain and regulatory framework will impact future technological choices among current, second or third generation production processes. A better understanding of the dynamic of the whole industry is thus needed for informed policy. This paper relies on a TIMES prospective model of French bioenergy sector we developed that gives a dynamic technology allocation under constraints. We find that avoided emissions of the biofuel sector could range from 12 MtCO2eq for current regulatory context to 16 MtCO2eq for the future one. The higher is the mitigation level, the higher is the associated abatement cost: from less than 200 €/tCO2eq to more than 6000 €/tCO2eq as it would imply the development of advanced processes, such as algae biofuels. Externalities play a significant role on the technology merit order, and must also be considered for designing future incentive policy.},

The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization (EEO) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis. We present the algebraic formulation of Temoa and conduct a verification exercise by implementing a simple test system in both Temoa and MARKAL, a widely used commercial model of the same type. In addition, a stochastic optimization of the test system is presented as a proof-of-concept application of uncertainty analysis using the Temoa framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper compares North American results from 17 models and discusses their policy motivation. Oil and natural gas production in the three major countries are modestly sensitive to crude oil and natural gas price changes, although these elasticities are below unity. Carbon taxes displace coal and some natural gas with renewables within all three power markets. Lower natural gas prices replace coal and some renewables with natural gas within electric generation. Higher intermittent renewable penetration in the power sector displaces coal and some natural gas. A key conclusion is that much remains to be done in integrating future analyses and in sharing and improving the quality and consistency of the underlying data.},

abstract = {To make an active contribution to the global effort in mitigation of climate change, Taiwan government has implemented the "Frameworks for Sustainable Energy Policy-An Energy-Saving and Carbon-Reduction Action Plan" in June 2008. It has made a commitment of a stepwise reduction of nationwide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which returns the nationwide GHG emission to 2008 levels by 2020, then reduces to 2000 levels by 2025, and finally cuts 50% of 2000 levels by 2050. The fundamental strategy is to reduce the GHG emission under acceptable economic development and energy security to achieve generation-spanning triple-win in energy, environment and economy. The major policy instruments such as "Statute for Renewable Energy Development", "GHG Reduction Law (draft)," "Regulation for Energy Tax (draft)," and "Energy Management Act" have been either implemented or scheduled for legislative reviewing. The purpose of this paper is to present an updated review of the outcomes of GHG emission reduction in Taiwan. In addition, the progress and priority of policy instruments in GHG emission reduction are analyzed as well. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the passenger-car sector in Japan are increasing rapidly and should be reduced cost-effectively in order to stabilize energy-related CO2 emissions in Japan. The purpose of the present paper is to clarify the most cost-effective mix of vehicles for reducing CO2 emissions and to estimate the subsidy that is necessary to achieve this vehicle mix. For this analysis, the energy system of Japan from 1988 to 2032 is modeled using a MARKAL model. The most cost-effective mix of vehicles is estimated by minimizing the total energy system cost under the constraint of an 8% energy-related CO2 emissions reduction nationally by 2030 from the CO2 emissions of 1990. Based on the results of the analysis, hybrid vehicles are the only type of clean-energy vehicle, and their share of the passenger car sector in 2030 will be 62%. By assuming the subsidization of hybrid vehicles, the same vehicle mix can be achieved without constraining CO2 emissions. The peak of the total subsidy estimated to be necessary is 1.225 billion US$/year in 2020, but the annual revenue of the assumed 31 US$/t-C carbon tax from the passenger car sector is sufficient to finance the estimated subsidy. This suggests that we should support the dissemination of hybrid vehicles through subsidization based on carbon tax. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As climate negotiators work towards a deal that would limit the increase in global temperatures, interest is growing in the essential role technology innovation can and must play in enabling the transition to a low-carbon energy system. Indeed, recent success stories clearly indicate that there is significant and untapped potential for accelerating innovation in clean technologies if proper policy frameworks are in place. In an especially timely analysis, the 2015 edition of Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP 2015) examines innovation in the energy technology sector and seeks to increase confidence in the feasibility of achieving short- and long-term climate change mitigation targets through effective research, development, demonstration and deployment (RDD&D). ETP 2015 identifies regulatory strategies and co‑operative frameworks to advance innovation in areas like variable renewables, carbon capture and storage, and energy-intensive industrial sectors. The report also shows how emerging economies, and China in particular, can foster a low-carbon transition through innovation in energy technologies and policy. Finally, ETP 2015 features the IEA annual Tracking Clean Energy Progress report, which this year shows that efforts to decarbonise the global energy sector are lagging further behind. By setting out pathways to a sustainable energy future and by incorporating detailed and transparent quantitative modelling analysis and well-rounded commentary, ETP 2015 and its series of related publications are required reading for experts in the energy field, policy makers and heads of governments, as well as business leaders and investors.},

The aim of this work is to assess the technical and economic potential of Demand Side Management (DSM) in Nigeria given different future levels of industrialisation. The paper places industrialisation at the centrefold of the appraisal of DSM potential in Nigeria. It does so by designing industrialisation scenarios and consequently deriving different DSM penetration levels using a cost-optimisation model. Findings show that under the high industrialisation scenario by the year 2050 DSM could bring about 7 billion USD in cumulative savings thanks to deferred investment in new generation and full deployment of standby assets along with interruptible programmes for larger industrial users. The paper concludes by providing policy recommendations regarding financial mechanisms to increase DSM deployment in Nigeria. The focus on DSM serves to shift the policy debate on electricity in Nigeria from a static state versus market narrative on supply to an engagement with the agency and influence on industrial end-users.},

abstract = {The energy balance of Greece is strongly dependent on imported oil. The rather late introduction of natural gas has increased the diversity of the energy mix while the share of renewable sources in primary energy supply still needs to increase according to the existing potential. Yet, Greece as one of the most of the EU developed countries encounters a serious task: the need to increase its electricity production of almost 5% per year but at the same time to reduce the CO2 emissions according with the National and International (20-20-20) regulations and allocation plans. Therefore reducing CO2 emissions has become a major priority for national government. In addition, from 2013, there will be the full implementation of the wholesale market in the European Trading Scheme (ETS) which is currently in the last stages of a transition phase. In Greece electricity is mainly generated from lignite, thus making the electricity sector one of the main contributors to GHG emissions with a level above 40% of the total country and higher than the corresponding average of the rest of the EU countries. The possible implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies would then become very decisive due to the large use of the lignite as fuel in the country electricity mix. CCS technology has the potential of increasing the flexibility on the achievement greenhouse gas emissions reduction by allowing to continue to use fossil fuels, which still guarantees feasibility in the energy sector. This work presents a roadmap with the modeling of the main technologies associated to the CCS and its implementation into the Greek energy system considering existing National and International Strategic energy plans under different scenarios. The implementation of CCS technologies would have a large influence on the national electrical power production, having the responsibility for large shares of the emissions reduction that can potentially achieved in this sector. For this purpose, TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL/EFOM System) has been chosen as the principal tool for building a technoeconomic model of the Greek energy system and its possible evaluation over time (2040). {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {With a vibrant economic development, Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA) would need to boast low-carbon electricity generation, reduce carbon emissions, and re-structure transportation, yet having no energy management plan. The main objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing energy impacts and macroeconomic effects of low-carbon scenarios and to identify a sustainable pathway towards 2050 for GKMA. The study uses TIMES/CGE hybrid framework to address the knowledge gap in 4 scenarios. Business as usual is the reference case with Kabejja (20% CO2 abatement), Carbon-Tax (100$/ton), and Lutta (95% CO2 abatement) as alternative scenarios. The analysis shows an increase in consumption from 139.6PJ to 469.35PJ and carbon emissions from 4.6mtns to 7mtns in the reference case. However, consumption and carbon emissions decrease in all the alternative scenarios compared to the reference case. The GDP and equivalent variation (EV) in household welfare increase in all alternative scenarios compared to the reference case. Lutta promises a 60.6% reduction in the carbon emissions intensity of GDP to be realistic. Sustainability is achievable when low-carbon electricity becomes the major contributor to the demand by fuel type, optimization of the total primary energy supply, and construction of an electrified Kampala metro. Transportation, Industrial and Residential sectors are the greatest emitters of CO2 by sector in all scenarios and thus need policy interventions to realize deep CO2 emissions reductions. The study recommends that Lutta guarantee a sustainable low-carbon footprint for GKMA.},

The UK MARKAL technology-focused energy systems dynamic cost optimisation model-which has been used to quantify the costs and benefits of alternative energy strategies in UK policy making-is enhanced with detailed representation of bio-energy chains and end-uses. This provides an important advance in linking bioenergy expert-knowledge with a whole system modelling approach, in order to better understand the potential role of bioenergy in an evolving energy system. The new BIOSYS-MARKAL model is used to run four scenarios constructed along the pillars of UK energy policy objectives (low carbon and energy security). The results are analysed in terms of bioenergy resources use and bioenergy pathways penetration in different end use sectors. The main findings suggest that the complexity of different bioenergy pathways may have been overlooked in previous modelling exercises. A range of bioenergy pathways-notably bio-heat and biofuels for transport-may have a much wider potential role to play. The extent to which this potential is fulfilled will be further determined by resources availability, and market segment constraints, as well as policy measures to improve deployment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

MARKAL is a well-known optimization model of the energy-economy system; CIMS is a policy simulation model developed initially for Canada. The models require the same technology and financial data, but CIMS, which does not assume financial cost minimization, also requires information on technology preferences, risk perceptions, tax effects and other critical factors in the decision making of firms and households in order to simulate their likely response to policies. Given the market inertia that is incorporated in a CIMS simulation, it estimates higher costs of emission reduction than MARKAL. CIMS' present value cost estimate for Canada to achieve its Kyoto target of 6% below 1990 emissions by 2010 is $45 billion (CDN) while MARKAL's is $15 billion. When linked to a macro-economic model, the GDP impact of CIMS is 3% while that of MARKAL is less than 1%. This difference would have been slightly larger had all target assumptions of the two models been identical. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bottom-up long-term planning models generally consider low levels of spatial, temporal, and technical details to reduce associated computation. However, these details are required to capture spatial and temporal variability of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and perform harmonized dispatch of conventional generating units. In their absence, models may overestimate RESs uptake and underestimate the quantum of required flexible resources. This may create a false impression of sector decarbonization and the obtained capacity mix may result in frequent RES or load curtailment during real-time system operations. In this context, this study aims to improve upon the shortcomings of conventional planning approaches and develop a TIMES based planning model for the Indian power sector. The model adopts high spatial and temporal definitions of 5 regions and 288 sub-annual timeslices. RESs are categorized into sub-classes based on annual capacity factors to capture their intra-regional variations without further increasing the spatial resolution. Each month is represented by a day of chronological hourly resolution that facilitates the capture of RES temporal variations and incorporation of operational aspects of generating units such as minimum stable generation, ramp limits and partial load operation. The impact of these operational parameters on system planning is analysed to identify a trade-off between planning accuracy and computational complexity. The study is relevant for countries that are rigorously following their decarbonization plans with high penetration of variable RESs and have a similar trajectory as that of India. The results indicate that decarbonization levels can be better assessed if capacity mix and flexible resources are adequately valued by considering operational parameters at the planning stage for a power system dominated by low flexible generation.},

abstract = {The need for technological transition of electricity production becomes a global problem. However, in coal-dominated Polish power system this need is even more crucial than anywhere, since technical lifetime of the most domestic power plants is ending. In this paper, the impact of the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) for CO2 combined with sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission trading mechanism on power technology choice was studied using Market Allocation (MARKAL) model of Polish power system. Poland can contribute to achieving ambitious EU CO2 emission reduction goals to 2050 by switching to diversified electricity mix of low-carbon coal technologies with CCS, and carbon-free options e.g. nuclear, biomass IGCC, wind onshore and offshore. This ‘low-carbon' mix can be achieved only at high emission allowance prices, stimulated by the introduction of Market Stability Reserve to EU ETS and successive decrease in EU CO2 emission cap. At high emission allowance prices, Poland's CO2 emissions from ETS-participating electricity generating plants are expected to decrease in 2010–2050 period by 96–99%, depending on the projected electricity consumption. Model results prove that SO2/NOx emission trading scheme, envisaged in Poland, is not effective, in view of Industrial Emission Directive implementation, and should be reconsidered.},

The research described here was devised to represent this potential, and thereby explore the possible role of marine energy in future energy systems. The paper describes a scenario for the accelerated development of marine energy technology, and the incorporation of this scenario into wider scenarios of UK energy system decarbonisation from now to 2050. The scenarios suggest that the accelerated development of marine energy could contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of energy supply in the UK, especially over the medium to long term. However, this is predicated on sustained innovation, learning and cost reduction over time. Encouragingly, a number of recently established policy support programmes are now beginning to stimulate the development of marine energy in Scotland, the UK and beyond. As the paper discusses, building on these initiatives, and 'realising' the accelerated development of marine energy, present a number of challenges, and will increasingly require international efforts.

The goal of this study is the identification of the viable technology and legal options for CO2 mitigation, and the impact assessment of the options for the Korean power generation sector. The MARKAL modeling package of IEA/ETSAP was used as an appropriate tool to make the database of Korean energy system in the model and assess the effects of the options. Several scenarios were made to study the effect of CO2 emission reductions on the Korean power generation sector, and these were classified as the Base Scenario, New Technology Scenario, Carbon Tax Scenario, Total Carbon Emission Cap Scenario, and mixtures of the scenarios. Under the base scenario based on the National Electricity Plan of Korea, the future power generation will be dominated by nuclear and coal power plants, with some of natural gas fired plant and a very small proportion of renewables. However, with increasing pressure to mitigate CO2 emissions, the analysis results of all four scenarios and combination of the scenarios showed that Korea would have to adopt a little different approach. An extensive modeling work was, therefore, undertaken to analyze the impact of various measures on introduction of new technologies and policies in order to achieve significant CO2 emissions reduction. As results of this work, we found estimated average cost for a ton carbon mitigation and estimated amount of CO2 emission reduction by application of each scenario including constraint of lower limit of coal power generation for security of energy supplies in Korea. The results obtained are to be suggested as recommendation in establishing a sustainable energy portfolio within the Korean power generation sector. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III report emphasized that climate policies can deliver energy security as a co-benefit, in large part through reducing energy imports. Using five state-of-the-art global energy-economy models and eight long-term scenarios, we show that although deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions would reduce energy imports, the reverse is not true: ambitious policies constraining energy imports would have an insignificant impact on climate change. Restricting imports of all fuels would lower twenty-first-century emissions by only 2-15% against the Baseline scenario as compared with a 70% reduction in a 450 stabilization scenario. Restricting only oil imports would have virtually no impact on emissions. The modelled energy independence targets could be achieved at policy costs comparable to those of existing climate pledges but a fraction of the cost of limiting global warming to 2 °C.},

However, there is still great uncertainty surrounding the size of this potential market and therefore its impact on the global gas trade. In order to identify some of the important factors that might drive natural gas consumption in key demand areas in China, we focus on three regions: Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai. Using the economic optimization model MARKAL, we initially assume that the drivers are government mandates of emissions standards, reform of the Chinese financial structure, the price and available supply of natural gas, and the rate of penetration of advanced power generating and end-use. The results from the model show that the level of natural gas consumption is most sensitive to policy scenarios, which strictly limit SO2 emissions from power plants. The model also revealed that the low cost of capital for power plants in China boosts the economic viability of capital-intensive coal-fired plants. This suggests that reform within the financial sector could be a lever for encouraging increased natural gas use. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Seven General Equilibrium (CGE) and energy system models on either the global or national scale are soft-linked and harmonized with respect to population and economic assumptions. We simulate a climate regime, based on long-term convergence of per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, starting from the emission pledges presented in the Copenhagen Accord to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and allowing full emissions trading between countries. Under the climate regime, Indian emission allowances are allowed to grow more than the Chinese allowances, due to the per capita convergence rule and the higher population growth in India. Economic and energy implications not only differ among the two countries, but also across model types. Decreased energy intensity is the most important abatement approach in the CGE models, while decreased carbon intensity is most important in the energy system models. The reduction in carbon intensity is mostly achieved through deployment of carbon capture and storage, renewable energy sources and nuclear energy. The economic impacts are generally higher in China than in India, due to higher 2010–2050 cumulative abatement in China and the fact that India can offset more of its abatement cost though international emission trading.},

abstract = {Coal-condensing power is marginal production in the deregulated Nordic power market and an increase in electricity consumption will therefore result in increased CO2 emissions. One goal of the Swedish energy policy is to reduce the amount of electricity used for heating in the building sector. This paper investigates the potential for reduction in electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating, taking the energy infrastructure into account, here defined as the capital stock of the buildings and heating systems together with geographical variations in heat intensity. In order to include the energy infrastructure in the analysis the study is made on a regional level (Southern Sweden) applying a comprehensive database describing the energy infrastructure of the region. The paper compares two scenarios for converting the heating systems of the region: one employing energy savings and with the aim to phase out the oil and most of the electricity used for heating purposes and a second which illustrates the effect if the current trend in the heating market continues. Both scenarios apply commercially available technologies only. From the second scenario it is seen that the current trend-contrary to the aim of the Swedish Governmental policy-shows an increase in electricity dependency for heating, mainly due to a large diffusion of heat pumps, but also due to installations of electrical floor heating and electricity heating systems installed in newly constructed one- and two-dwelling buildings. However, the options proposed in first scenario show that it is possible to reach significant reductions in the electricity dependency due to heating and in corresponding CO2 emissions. An analysis of the age structure of the heating systems shows that the transformation of the heating system is not completed until the year 2025, if new investments for replacement of heating systems are made only provided they have reached their economical life time, and only applying heating technologies which at present are known to be economically competitive. It can be concluded that future policies on transforming the energy system should be based on an analysis that takes the entire energy infrastructure (in this case of heating system) into account (e.g. not directed towards single technologies). More specifically for the region studied, which is considered representative for Sweden as a whole, policies should aim at installing heat pumps to replace electricity heating only in regions with low heat density where district heating is not competitive, in contrary to the present situation where heat pumps replace all types of heating systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The LCS modeling is soft-linked to global targets through regional emission constraints derived from the global stabilization targets. The disaggregated, yet soft-linked, assessments provide opportunities to articulate scenarios that include context-specific inputs, and thereby explicitly consider benefits and deliver more realistic and implementable roadmaps. We find that LCS modeling exercises are still at a relatively early stage in terms of modeling space, and need methodological enhancements. However, this approach offers considerable promise in a world where major emerging economies are undergoing rapid transformation, national and regional interests everywhere still precede global interests, and implementation of the carbon market remains fragmentary.

Three main scenarios are considered: a baseline scenario with current energy policies, an accelerated technology scenario (ACT) with an associated CO2 reduction incentive development, and a scenario in which global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 50% compared to current levels in 2050 (BLUE). The analysis suggests that CCS can account for up to 19% of all CO2 reduction in 2050, which would equal 10.4 Gt CO2 capture and storage. The power sector would account for 54% of all CCS, the remainder is in manufacturing industry and the fuel transformation sector. CCS is a critical option. Without CCS, the cost to meet the same target would rise by 71%. The potential rate at which CCS can be introduced exceeds the rate at which regular capital stock is typically replaced, if plants are retrofitted or closed down before the end of their technical life span. Retrofitting of coal plants with CCS plays a very significant role in the ACT Map scenario. But at the price of USD 200/t CO2 envisaged in the BLUE scenario, there is sufficient economic incentive to accelerate the replacement of inefficient power plants with new plants equipped with CCS before the existing plants reach the end of their life span. In the BLUE scenario, 350 GW of coal-fired power-plant capacity is closed down early. The remaining 700 GW consists of 80% new capacity that is equipped with CCS, and 20% retrofits with CCS. Following IEA recommendations, the G8 countries have announced that they will commit 20 demonstration plants for CCS by 2010. Also the G8, China India and Korea have asked the IEA to continue its work on roadmaps and transition paths for CCS in power generation and in industry, in cooperation with other bodies such as CSLF.

Compared with base case scenario, implementation of various energy scenarios could prevent 608-5144 and 1189-10,462 PM10-related avoidable deaths (mid-value) in 2010 and 2020, respectively; and it could also decrease substantial cases of relevant diseases. These findings illustrate that an effective energy and environmental policy will play an active role in reduction of air pollutant emissions, improvement of air quality, and public health. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The UK government sets a legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 80% by 2050, while ensuring a secure and affordable energy supply. Under the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) Energy 2050 project, four core scenario analyses have been undertaken to explore the pathways to a low carbon and resilient energy system. A resilience energy system is defined as the set of technologies, physical infrastructure, institutions, policies and practices located in and associated with the UK which enable energy services to be delivered to UK consumers. A number of models and analytical tools have been used for the resilient energy system analyses, and MARKAL model is one amongst them. Within the analytical framework of the UK MARKAL elastic demand (MED) model, the resilient energy system has been characterised though diversity in energy supply and reducing the final energy demand. A set of user-defined constraints have been chosen to model the resilient scenario in MED. The MED analyses try to seek answers to: Will investing in a resistant energy system make it easier or more difficult to reduce CO2 emissions? What is the additional cost of investing in resilient energy system compared to a low carbon energy system? The analyses show that a resilient energy system reduces CO2 emissions, but does not go far enough to stay on the pathway to the 2050 80% reduction target. This paper presents the type of constraints used in the MED analyses and key insights from the parametric analyses.},

This paper reports on a methodology for temporal disaggregation in the widely applied energy service driven, technology rich, cost optimizing, linear programming MARKAL energy system model. A flexible time slicing feature is developed to enhance representation of diurnal and seasonal electricity demand curves through disaggregation of resource availability and energy service demands. In a first application of a temporal UK MARKAL model, a range of runs investigate the role of electricity storage at supply and demand sides. The results display considerably enhanced insights, notably on the role and preference of demand-side electricity storage over supply-side storage. On average, the system chooses about 7-10% of electricity demand as storage. On the supply side, hydrogen-based electricity storage is greatly preferred but stored-hydrogen is used in the transport sector rather than for power system balancing mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The 2050 Swiss energy strategy envisages 30–75% introduction of electric cars by 2050, which is designed to support the goal of decarbonising the energy sector. While the Swiss government has decided to phase out nuclear electricity, deployment of electric cars can affect electricity supply and emission trajectories. Therefore, potential interactions between the electricity and transport sectors must be considered in assessing the future role of electric mobility. We analyse a set of scenarios using the Swiss TIMES energy system model with high temporal resolution. We generate insights into cross-sectoral trade-offs between electricity supply and electrification/decarbonisation of car fleets. E-mobility supports decarbonisation of car fleet even if electricity is supplied from large gas power plants or relatively low cost sources of imported electricity. However, domestic renewable based electricity generation is expected to be too limited to support e-mobility. Stringent abatement targets without centralised gas power plants render e-mobility less attractive, with natural gas hybrids becoming cost effective. Thus the cost effectiveness of electric mobility depends on policy decisions in the electricity sector. The substitution of fossil fuels with electricity in transport has the potential to reduce revenues from fuel taxation. Therefore it is necessary to ensure consistency between electricity sector and transport energy policies.},

Scenario and modelling assessment of this stringent target consistently finds that all sectors need to contribute to emissions reductions. The UK residential sector accounts for around 30% of the total final energy use and more than one-quarter of CO2 emissions. This paper focuses on modelling of the residential sector in a system wide energy-economy models (UK MARKAL) and key UK sectoral housing stock models. The UK residential energy demand and CO2 emission from the both approaches are compared. In an energy system with 60% economy-wide CO2 reductions, the residential sector plays a commensurate role. Energy systems analysis finds this reduction is primarily driven by energy systems interactions notably decarbonisation of the power sector combined with increased appliance efficiency. The stock models find alternate decarbonisation pathways based on assumptions related to the future building stock and behavioural changes. The paper concludes with a discussion on the assumptions and drivers of emission reductions in different models of the residential energy sector. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the incremental insights from this hourly model, it is compared to an aggregated model with only two diurnal timeslices like in most MARKAL/TIMES models. Two scenarios have been analysed with both models to answer the following questions: Are there differences in model solutions? What are the benefits of having a high number of timeslices? Are there any computational limitations? The primary objective of this paper is to understand the differences between the solutions of the two models, rather than Swiss policy implication or potential uncertainties in input parameters and assumptions. The analysis reveals that the hourly model offers powerful insights into the electricity generation schedule. Nevertheless, the TIMES framework cannot substitute for a dispatch model because some features cannot be represented; however, the long model time horizon and integrated system approaches of TIMES provide features not available in conventional dispatch models.

abstract = {The Swiss electricity system is dominated by low-carbon hydro and nuclear generation. The Government's decision to phase-out nuclear energy exacerbates Switzerland's climate change mitigation goals. Response to this challenge requires systemic changes to the energy system, which is generally a long-term, uncertain and systemic process, affected by technology choices across the entire energy system. A comprehensive Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM) with high temporal detail has been developed for the analysis of plausible low-carbon energy pathways focusing on uncertainties related to policy (climate change mitigation and acceptability of new centralised electricity generation) and international fuel prices. Increasing electrification of end-uses is seen across the scenarios, resulting in continuous growth in electricity demands. The electrification of heating and e-mobility substitute direct use of fossil fuels in end-use sectors and contribute to a significant carbon dioxide emission (CO2) reduction. Centralised gas power plants and renewables become key source of electricity supply. Given the phaseout of nuclear generation, clear policy signals are required to ensure capacity is built to achieve a low-carbon energy system. At the same time, it is also essential to ensure consistency between the electricity sector and end-use energy policies. For the long-term carbon reduction target, some non-cost-effective conservation measures are important early in the period because they are available only at the time of building renovation.},

abstract = {About one-third of the Swiss nuclear capacity is due to be retired in the next ten years, creating a short-term supply gap. In addition, the Swiss Federal Council has decided to phase out nuclear power over the longer term by not replacing existing nuclear power plants after retirement. We have analysed possible electricity supply options for responding to these two developments under different conditions using the Swiss TIMES electricity sector model-a least-cost optimization framework. Short-term demand can be cost-effectively met with new investment in gas-fired generation capacity. However, meeting the government's CO 2 emission and renewable electricity targets requires an accelerated investment in renewable generation and/or increased reliance on imported electricity. In the medium and longer term, nuclear represents the most cost-effective option. The alternatives to nuclear lead to increased dependence on imported natural gas, seasonal renewables and imported electricity. All non-nuclear supply options increase the cost of electricity supply by between 50 and 150%, and create a range of tradeoffs between supply security and climate change mitigation goal. However, it is expected that an accelerated uptake of end-use efficiency measures and demand side management would reduce future electricity demand, thus reducing the need for some expensive supply options. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Fusarium head blight (FHB, scab), caused by Fusarium graminearum or F. culmorum, results in yield and quality reductions and accumulation of mycotoxins. Two inoculation methods are commonly used. Spraying a spore suspension on the head (spray inoculation) will detect resistance to initial infection (type I) and to disease spread within the spike (type II). Injecting a spore suspension into individual florets (point inoculation) will detect type II resistance only. To analyze the association of spray and point inoculation, 20 elite winter wheat cultivars from Romania, Germany, and Switzerland were inoculated in factorial field experiments in seven environments (location x year combinations) in Germany and Romania. Response to FHB was assessed by the percentage of visually infected spikelets and head weight relative to the noninoculated control. Point and spray inoculations resulted in a mean disease severity varying from 52 to 63%. Significant (P = 0.01) genotypic variation was found within and across the environments. Genotype-environment interaction was important also. Estimates of entry-mean heritability were higher for spray than for point inoculation as assessed by percent infected spikelets (0.81 versus 0.77) and relative head weight (0.77 versus 0.52). Significant (P = 0.01) interaction was found between inoculation methods. Consequently, coefficients of phenotypic correlation between both methods were low to medium for percent infected spikelets (0.40, P > 0.1) and relative head weight (0.52, P = 0.05). We conclude that the application of both inoculation methods should provide additional information for selection and scientific studies. Spray inoculation, however, is less laborious for large-scale routine screening of breeding materials.},

abstract = {Purpose: This article is based on the REACCESS research project, sponsored by the European Commission, with the objectives of evaluating the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of present and future energy corridors between the European countries (EU27) and their main energy suppliers. GCC countries have an important role to play given their role in EU energy supply and in greenhouse gas emissions. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A single energy model was built by hard-linking the TIMES integrated assessment model (TIAM-World), the Pan European TIMES model (PET), and the RECOR model (REaccess CORridors), including more than 1,000 possible energy corridors supplying the European countries. Another major methodology advance was to create a hybrid objective function, combining the usual cost objective and a metric representing the supply risk incurred by EU27. The risk component was constructed via a novel approach that aggregates the elemental risk parameters of each corridor using a Min-Max function. Four contrasted scenarios were assessed, based on security and climate objectives. Findings: Among the many results, it appears that a large reduction of the supply risk may be achieved at a very modest increase of the total energy system cost for EU27. Cross-effects of climate mitigation and security objectives are also observed. Due to the diversification requirement, the contribution of GCC countries to EU energy imports increases under risk scenario. Sensitivity analyses show that the European energy system seems unable to reduce the market shares of fossil fuels import from MENA countries, including GCC countries, much below the reference case, proving the strong dependency of EU27 energy system from these countries. However, total fossil fuels imports, as well as total energy consumed, are decreased under the risk adverse scenarios. Originality/value: Methodological developments, as described above, result in an advanced tool to assess how to increase the "energy system security", by reducing the concentration of supply countries, diversifying import sources but also reducing the energy dependence at the end-use side. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Following a multi-scenario framework based on the technology assumptions proposed by the 27th Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-27), our analysis focuses on analyzing the impacts of key technology assumptions on climate policies, including the interdependencies of different technological options. Each scenario may be considered as either a possible state of nature upon which one has no influence, each scenario thus dictating the availability (or non availability) of some subset of the technology groups, or as an opportunity for society, by its own actions and policies, to influence the availability of said technology group. The main insights obtained from the assessment show the prominent role of bioenergy as a means to abate greenhouse gas emissions, irrespective of other technological developments, while the role of the other technologies (wind and solar, carbon capture and sequestration, nuclear) are more dependent of one another. It appears that CCS may play a sort of "backstop" role: it compensates for a lower contribution of solar and wind, or of nuclear. This means that an increased social acceptability of one (or all) of these three sets of technology should be at the heart of future climate policies. The costs caused by the adaptation of electricity networks to accommodate a high fraction of intermittent sources would deserve more attention in future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Each of these new features is illustrated by results taken from large-scale extended MARKAL models of Quebec and Ontario.

abstract = {Future patterns of climate change and economic growth are critical parameters in long-term energy planning. This paper describes a multi-stage stochastic programming approach to formulate a flexible energy plan. The plan incorporates multiple future scenarios and provides for mid-course corrections depending upon the actual realizations of future uncertainties. Results are derived from the stochastic version of Extended MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) model for Qu{\'{e}}bec, developed for this purpose. The analysis indicates significant savings of overall system cost in using a hedging strategy over any of the perfect foresight ones. With a 50% probability of implementing stringent carbon mitigation measures after 15 years, the emission trajectory takes the middle path till this uncertainty is resolved. Prior to resolution, electricity supply follows the middle path, natural gas and renewable energy tend to follow the low mitigation trajectory, and oil supply approaches the high mitigation trajectory. A set of specialized hedging technologies has been identified, which emerges more competitive in the hedging strategy than in any of the perfect foresight ones. The paper concludes that such treatment of future uncertainties can give insights that are beyond the scope of an analysis based on deterministic scenarios. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Combined heat and power (CHP) is promoted as an economical, energy-efficient option for reducing air emissions, mitigating carbon emissions and reducing reliance on grid electricity. However, its potential benefits have only been analyzed within the context of the current energy system. To fully examine the viability of CHP as a clean-technology alternative, its growth must be analyzed considering how the energy sector may transform under the influence of various technological and policy drivers that are specifically geared toward limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Scenarios were developed through a bottom-up technology model of the U.S. energy system to determine the impacts on CHP development and both system-wide and sectoral GHG and air pollutant emissions. Various scenarios were considered, from CO2 emissions reductions in the electric generating units (EGU) sector to GHG reductions across the whole energy system while considering levels of CHP investment. The largest CHP investments were observed in scenarios that limited CO2 emission from the EGU sector alone. The investments were scaled back in the scenarios that incorporated energy system level GHG reductions. The energy system level reduction scenarios yielded rapid transformation of the EGU sector towards zero-emissions technologies as reliance on electricity increases with the electrification of the many end-use sectors such as buildings, transportation and industrial sectors, reducing investment in CHP. The prime mover and fuel choice heavily influenced the air pollutant emissions resulting in trade-offs among pollutants including GHG emissions. The results suggest that CHP could play a role in a future low-carbon energy system, but that role diminishes as carbon reduction targets increase.},

The techno-economic energy system analysis is performed by TIMES-DK model, which optimizes over all sectors in Denmark until 2050. The connection to district heating proved to be optimal from the system perspective. A spreadsheet model has been developed to perform the private-economic analysis and the evaluation of externalities. New biomass boilers proved to be the cheapest from the private-economic perspective; district heating came close. At the voting, heat pumps and biomass boilers received the most votes. One of these two solutions will be implemented. Why district heating received the least votes calls for detailed investigation.},

The question of which sectors contribute how much has already been discussed, but is far from decided, while the question of which countries shoulder how much of the tightened reduction targets has hardly been discussed. We want to contribute significantly to answering these policy questions by analysing the necessary burden sharing within the EU from both an energy system and an overall macroeconomic perspective. For this purpose, we use the energy system model TIMES PanEU and the computational general equilibrium model NEWAGE. Our results show that excessively strong targets for the Emission Trading System (ETS) in 2030 are not system-optimal for achieving the 55% overall target, reductions should be made in such a way that an emissions budget ratio of 39 (ETS sector) to 61 (Non-ETS sector) results. Economically weaker regions would have to reduce their CO2 emissions until 2030 by up to 33% on top of the currently decided targets in the Effort Sharing Regulation, which leads to higher energy system costs as well as losses in gross domestic product (GDP). Depending on the policy scenario applied, GDP losses in the range of −0.79% and −1.95% relative to baseline can be found for single EU regions. In the long-term, an equally strict mitigation regime for all countries in 2050 is not optimal from a system perspective; total system costs would be higher by 1.5%. Instead, some countries should generate negative net emissions to compensate for non-mitigable residual emissions from other countries.},

To qualify under the Renewable Fuel Standard, cellulosic ethanol and new corn ethanol must demonstrate 60% and 20% lower emissions than petroleum fuels, respectively. A combined corn-grain and corn-stover ethanol system could potentially satisfy a major portion of renewable fuel production goals. This work examines multiple LCA allocation procedures for a hypothetical system producing ethanol from both corn grain and corn stover. Allocation choice is known to strongly influence GHG emission results for corn-ethanol. Stover-derived ethanol production further complicates allocation practices because additional products result from the same corn production system. This study measures the carbon intensity of ethanol fuels against EISA limits using multiple allocation approaches. Allocation decisions are shown to be paramount. Under varying approaches, carbon intensity for corn ethanol was 36-79% that of gasoline, while carbon intensity for stover-derived ethanol was -10% to 44% that of gasoline. Producing corn-stover ethanol dramatically reduced carbon intensity for corn-grain ethanol, because substantially more ethanol is produced with only minor increases in emissions.

Therefore, comprehensive model-based studies on the economic viability of CCU for decarbonizing the industrial sector can provide effective solutions for controlling carbon emissions from petrochemical industry. In this study, we investigated 1) the roles that CCU could play in Japan's decarbonization pathways to meet the country's 2050 carbon emission goals, 2) factors that influence CCU deployment, and 3) how the market penetration of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) could affect CCU deployment. Notably, we applied the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model and extended it to integrate CCU technologies and represent chemical production processes, including those required to manufacture basic petrochemical products. Furthermore, the total optimal (minimized) system cost was determined, while considering climate policies and technological assumptions, by analyzing scenarios based on various parameters associated with CO2 emissions and CCU costs. Our study indicates that CCU has the potential to reduce the use of fossil fuel-based energy required by the petrochemical industry by 32%, thus, substantially contributing to Japan's 2050 CO2 emissions target. Notably, CCU technology can play a key role in near-future decarbonization efforts, especially in cases where ZEV penetration is not as fast as expected.},

abstract = {A major characteristic of our global interactive climate-energy system is the large uncertainty that exists with respect to both future environmental requirements and the means available for fulfilling these. Potentially, a key technology for leading the transition from the current fossil fuel-dominated energy system to a more sustainable one is carbon dioxide capture and storage. Uncertainties exist, however, concerning the large-scale implementability of this technology, such as related to the regional availability of storage sites for the captured CO2. We analyze these uncertainties from an integrated assessment perspective by using the bottom-up model TIAM-ECN and by studying a set of scenarios that cover a range of different climate targets and technology futures. Our study consists of two main approaches: (1) a sensitivity analysis through the investigation of a number of scenarios under perfect foresight decision making and (2) a stochastic programming exercise that allows for simultaneously considering a set of potential future states-of-the-world. We find that, if a stringent climate (forcing) target is a possibility, it dominates the solution: if deep CO2 emission reductions are not started as soon as possible, the target may become unreachable. Attaining a stringent climate target comes in any case at a disproportionally high price, which indicates that adaptation measures or climate damages might be preferable to the high mitigation costs such a target implies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This article illustrates the main difficulties encountered in the preparation of GHG emission projections and climate change mitigation policies and measures (P&M) for Kazakhstan. Difficulties in representing the system with an economic model have been overcome by representing the energy system with a technical-economic growth model (MARKAL-TIMES) based on the stock of existing plants, transformation processes, and end-use devices. GHG emission scenarios depend mainly on the pace of transition in Kazakhstan from a planned economy to a market economy. Three scenarios are portrayed: an incomplete transition, a fast and successful one, and even more advanced participation in global climate change mitigation, including participation in some emission trading schemes. If the transition to a market economy is completed by 2020, P&M already adopted may reduce emissions of CO2 from combustion by about 85 MtCO2 by 2030 – 17% of the emissions in the baseline (WOM) scenario. One-third of these reductions are likely to be obtained from the demand sectors, and two-thirds from the supply sectors. If every tonne of CO2 not emitted is valued up to US$10 in 2020 and $20 in 2030, additional P&M may further reduce emissions by 110 MtCO2 by 2030. Policy relevance: This article analyses Kazakhstan's climate change and energy efficiency policies by making use of a modelling platform that provides a consistent framework for testing dynamic hypotheses. The effects of different P&M have been evaluated as he differences between two scenarios according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting guidelines. It concludes that domestic climate mitigation objectives are synergistic with energy efficiency goals, and the set of policies adopted to achieve both objectives should be planned, implemented, and enforced jointly. It also quantifies the GHG emissions reduction if the transition to a market economy proceeds quickly and successfully ($\sim$ - 100 MtCO2e in 2030), and if a mitigation-specific policy is implemented ($\sim$ - 200 MtCO2e in 2030) compared to a baseline projection, and it highlights the need to prepare more robust and detailed energy balances and inventory of emissions in order to develop and monitor the progress of the policies},

abstract = {Problems with unsustainable use of energy by households and lack of access to energy infrastructure require effective actions from the policy makers. Energy system models can usefully analyze future residential sector energy pathways “within” the full energy system. However, few energy system models have been developed with disaggregated sub-national regional detail, building type and urban/rural divisions. This paper addresses this key gap. Disaggregating the residential sector by building categories allows improved representation of the range of energy transition options across building categories. We incorporated a novel detailed building stock module into a 16-region TIMES energy systems model for Kazakhstan, using statistical data on the housing stock and building energy audit reports. We then explore the introduction of a coal ban and use scenario analysis to identify the most cost-effective heating technologies for the different regions and different building types. Implications of the residential sector policies to the supply side energy infrastructure were also quantified. The energy transition (from solid fuels to cleaner alternatives) is rarely achievable without Government intervention, therefore scenarios with ban on coal use and clean energy technology subsidies (micro-CHP, heat pumps and solar space heaters) have been investigated in this study. The results indicate that in rural areas networked gas (for detached households) and district heating (for flats) are more economically viable substitutes to coal, even with subsidies offered for clean technologies. In the scenario with the constraint on gas network expansion and clean technology subsidies, there is a wide utilization of heat pumps in detached rural houses. Subsidies for retrofit measures are effective with wide utilization, especially in the areas affected by the coal ban, with up to 76% reduction of the useful energy demand. The total amount of allocated subsidies for clean technologies amounted for up to 32% and 8% of the current state social and health care expenditures. A coal ban in the residential sector is estimated to achieve emissions reductions for PM2.5 and CO of 92% and 95%, respectively (compared to the base year level), even accounting for emissions from the supply side (power plants, heat plants).},

This paper addresses the issue of abatement costs and potentials in the housing stock from a systems perspective in order to capture interactions and interdependencies with the wider energy system. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves for the UK residential sector are derived based on the energy systems model UK MARKAL in combination with decomposition analysis. The results indicate that it is cost-effective to implement conservation measures, as well as increase the share of district heat and biomass for space and water heating. The decarbonisation of electricity and heat dominates the lower part of the residential sector MAC curve up to {\pounds}50/t CO2. The MAC curve is found to be robust to fossil fuel prices, while more expensive electricity and limited availability of biomass significantly reduce the abatement potential.

Several meta-analyses and model comparisons have previously been performed that aim to identify the causes for the wide range of MAC curves. Most of these concentrate on general equilibrium models with a focus on aspects such as specific model type and technology learning, while other important aspects remain almost unconsidered, including the availability of abatement technologies and level of discount rates. This paper addresses the influence of several key parameters on MAC curves for the United Kingdom and the year 2030. A technology-rich energy system model, UK MARKAL, is used to derive the MAC curves. The results of this study show that MAC curves are robust even to extreme fossil fuel price changes, while uncertainty around the choice of the discount rate, the availability of key abatement technologies and the demand level were singled out as the most important influencing factors.

abstract = {In order to reduce energy-related CO2 emissions different options have been considered: energy efficiency improvements, structural changes to low carbon or zero carbon fuel/technologies, carbon sequestration, and reduction in energy-service demands (useful energy). While efficiency and technology options have been extensively studied within the context of climate change mitigation, this paper addresses the possible role of price-related energy-service demand reduction. For this analysis, the elastic demand version of the TIAM-UCL global energy system model is used in combination with decomposition analysis. The results of the CO2 emission decomposition indicate that a reduction in energy-service demand can play a limited role, contributing around 5% to global emission reduction in the 21st century. A look at the sectoral level reveals that the demand reduction can play a greater role in selected sectors like transport contributing around 16% at a global level. The societal welfare loss is found to be high when the price elasticity of demand is low. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Availability of and access to water and energy are key ingredients for economic and social development. Unfortunately, more than a billion people still lack access to both safe freshwater and basic energy services. Future predictions show that the situation may become worse with about a 40% increase in energy demand and 30% increase in water demand by 2040. In addition, water and energy are highly interdependent, with water needed in all phases of the energy lifecycle and energy needed in all phases of the water lifecycle. While recent years have seen an increasing number of studies on the water-energy nexus, the research is focused on scattered individual areas of the nexus, each important in their own right. However, there is now a need to synthesize these efforts and identify the most important elements needed for a holistic water-energy nexus methodology. This paper focuses on the benefits to be gained from and the drawbacks of ignoring various water-energy interlinks for policy makers and planners in their goals to meet long term resource security. Several possible combinations of socio-economic and climate change scenarios make these goals even more challenging. The lessons learnt from reviewing different integration methodologies and studies are compiled into a list of key recommendations. It is found that current integration efforts are often biased towards the energy sector and its water requirements. There is still a need for better representations of the water infrastructure and corresponding linkages with the energy sector. There is also a need to harmonize the energy and water systems from both a technical and policy perspective. This calls for compatible disaggregation of spatial and temporal elements in both systems as well as designing model outputs to allow evaluation of the synergies and tradeoffs of multi-scale, cross-sector policies.},

abstract = {Regional air pollution is strongly impacted by transportation emissions. Policy mechanisms to reduce emissions are required to reach environmental quality goals. Projecting the drivers (e.g., technical, economic, societal, regulatory) that will impact future emissions is challenging, and assessing regional air quality (AQ) is complicated by the need for detailed modeling tools and data inputs to simulate chemistry and transport of pollutants. This work assesses the contribution of emissions from transportation sources to ground-level concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter via two methods. First, impacts are quantified for three U.S. regions including California using output from an economic optimization model to grow a base year emissions inventory to 2055. Second, impacts are considered for California using state-level projections with an updated emissions inventory and modeling suite in 2035. For both, advanced AQ models are used, showing that the impacts of light duty vehicles are moderate, reflecting shifts to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. In contrast, heavy duty vehicles, ships, and off-road equipment are associated with important ozone and PM2.5 burdens. Emissions from petroleum fuel production and distribution activities also have notable impacts on ozone and PM2.5. These transportation sub-sectors should be the focus of future emissions reduction policies.},

In particular, wind power and bioenergy increase considerably beyond current deployment levels. Up to 2030, the transformation strategies are similar across all models and for both levels of emission reduction. However, mitigation becomes more challenging after 2040.

In Sweden, only about one third of the demand for district heat (DH) is supplied from CHP. This share could be significantly larger if the profitability of CHP generation increased. The objective of this study was to analyse the extent to which the profitability for investments in new CHP plants in the Swedish DH sector have changed thanks to the recently implemented trading schemes for green certificates (TGCs) and CO2 emissions (TEPs). The analysis was carried out using a simulation model of the Swedish DH sector in which the profitability of CHP investments for all DH systems, with and without the two trading schemes applied, is compared. In addition, a comparison was made of the changes in CHP generation, CO2 emissions, and operation costs if investments are made in the CHP plant shown to be most profitable in each system according to the model. The study shows that the profitability of investments in CHP plants increased significantly with the introductions of TGC and TEP schemes. If all DH utilities also undertook their most profitable CHP investments, the results indicate a major increase in power generation which, in turn, would reduce the CO2 emissions from the European power sector by up to 13 Mton/year, assuming that coal condensing power is displaced. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Swedish district-heating (DH) systems use a wide range of energy sources and technologies for heat-and-power generation. This provides the DH utilities with major flexibility in changing their fuel and technology mix when the economic conditions for generation change. Two recently introduced policy instruments have changed the DH utilities' costs for generation considerably; the tradable green-certificate (TGC) scheme introduced in 2003 in Sweden, and the tradable greenhouse-gas emission permit (TEP) scheme introduced in the EU on January 1, 2005. The objective of this study is to analyse how these two trading schemes impact on the operation of the Swedish DH sector in terms of changes in CHP generation, CO2 emissions, and operating costs. The analysis was carried out by comparing the most cost-effective operation for the DH utilities, with and without, the two trading schemes applied, using a model that handles the Swedish DH-sector system-by-system. It was found that the volume of renewable power generated in CHP plants only increased slightly owing to the TGC scheme. The TGC and the TEP schemes in force together, however, nearly doubled the renewable power-generation. CO2 emissions from the DH sector may either increase or decrease depending on the combination of TGC and TEP prices. The overall CO2 emissions from the European power-generation sector would, however, be reduced for all price combinations assuming that increased Swedish CHP generation replaces coal-condensing power (coal-fired plants with power generation only) in other European countries. The trading schemes also lower the operational costs of the DH sector since the cost increase owing to the use of more expensive fuels and the purchase of TEPs is outweighed by the increased revenues from sales of electricity and TGCs. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in the industry sector to achieve climate stabilisation targets will be difficult to attain without recourse to CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems. Using a bottom-up energy system model with cost optimisation running to 2100, as well as a short-term engineering cost review, this paper investigates the case for CCS in industrial sectors, including in developing countries. It concludes that there are various technical pathways for CCS to play a critical role in mitigation strategies and that CCS in industry has more advantages than CCS in the electricity sector. CO2 capture costs are, in many cases, lower in industry than in the power sector. Excluding CCS in the power sector from the portfolio of mitigation options increases total cumulative climate policy costs of a 2°C temperature stabilisation scenario by USD 34 trillion until 2100 (some 10 % increase compared to the case in which CCS is availability for all sectors). Even higher costs occur if CCS technologies are excluded from the mitigation portfolio of the industry sector. In this case, cumulative climate policy costs increase by USD 175 trillion until 2100, corresponding to additional 50 % of the policy costs of the scenario with full availability of CCS and five times more than the additional policy costs of the case that CCS is excluded from the electricity sector mitigation portfolio. CCS also seems to be more acceptable to social and environmental advocates if applied in industry, as opposed to the power sector where it may have an impact on renewable energy deployment. In order for CCS in industry to play a global role in climate change mitigation, it will need to be as much a priority in developed as in developing countries. Thus, policy and research activity should include international interventions in specific industrial sectors and in the development of biomass and CCS systems that could lead to an improved enabling environment for CCS in industry.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate energy supply investment requirements in Latin America until 2050 through a multi-model approach as jointly applied in the CLIMACAP-LAMP research project. We compare a business-as-usual scenario needed to satisfy anticipated future energy demand with a set of scenarios that aim to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in the region. We find that more than a doubling of annual investments, in absolute terms, occurs in the business-as-usual scenario between 2010 and 2050, while investments may treble over the same time horizon when climate policies are introduced. Investment costs as share of GDP, however, decline over time in the business-as-usual scenario as well as the climate policy scenarios, as a result of the fast economic growth of the region. In the business-as-usual scenario, cumulative investments of 1.4 trillion US$ are anticipated between 2010 and 2050 in electricity supply. These investments increase when additional climate policies are introduced: under a carbon tax of 50 $/tCO2e in 2020 growing with a rate of 4%/yr, an additional 0.6 trillion US$ (+ 45%) of cumulative investment is needed. Climate control measures lead to increased investment in low-carbon electricity technologies, primarily based on wind and solar resources, as well as CCS applied to fossil fuels and biomass. Our analysis suggests that, in comparison to the business-as-usual case, an average additional 21 billion US$/yr of electricity supply investment is required in Latin America until 2050 under a climate policy aiming at 2 °C climate stabilisation. Conversely, there is a disinvestment in fossil fuel extraction and transformation. For oil production, a growth to 130 billion US$ annual investment by 2050 is anticipated in a business-as-usual scenario. Ambitious climate policy reduces this to 28 billion US$. Mobilising the necessary additional investment capital, in particular for low-carbon energy technologies, will be a challenge. Suitable frameworks and enabling environments for a scale-up of public and private investment will be critical to help reach the required low-carbon energy deployment levels.},

We compare two carbon tax scenarios with a business-as-usual scenario of anticipated future energy demand. In the short term, with carbon prices reaching around $15/tCO2 by 2030, most models agree that the reduction in consumer spending, as a proxy for welfare, is limited to about 0.3%. By 2050, at carbon prices of $165/tCO2, there is much more divergence in the estimated impact on consumer spending as well as GDP across models and regions, which reflects uncertainties about technology costs and substitution opportunities between technologies. We observe that the consequences of increasingly higher carbon prices, in terms of reduced consumer spending and GDP, tend to be fairly linear with the carbon price in our CGE models. However, the consequences are divergent and nonlinear in our econometric model, that is linked to an energy system model that simulates step-changes in technology substitution. The results of one model show that climate policy measures can have positive effects on consumer spending and GDP, which results from an investment stimulus and the redistribution of carbon price revenues to consumers.},

abstract = {In this article we explore regional burden-sharing regimes for the allocation of greenhouse gas emission reduction obligations needed to reach a 2°C long-Term global climate change control target by performing an integrated energy-economy-climate assessment with the bottom-up TIAM-ECN model. Our main finding is that, under a burden-sharing scheme based on the allowed emissions per capita, the sum of merchandized carbon certificates yields about 2000 billion US/yr worth of inter-regional trade around 2050, with China and Latin America the major buyers, respectively Africa, India, and other Asia the main sellers. Under a burden-sharing regime that aims at equal cost distribution, the aggregated amount of transacted carbon certificates involves less than 500 billion US/yr worth of international trade by 2050, with China and other Asia representing the vast majority of selling capacity. Restrictions in the opportunities for international certificate trade can have significant short-to mid-Term impact, with an increase in global climate policy costs of up to 20%.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in residential, commercial and transport sectors have been growing rapidly in the non-OECD Asian countries over the last decades, and the trend is expected to continue over the coming decades as well. However, the per capita projections for energy demand in these particular sectors often seem to be very low compared to the OECD average until 2050, and it is clear that the scenario assessments of final energy demands in these sectors include large uncertainties. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis have been carried out to study the impact of higher rates of energy demand growths in the non-OECD Asia on global mitigation costs. The long term energy and emission scenarios for China, India and South-East Asia have been contributed as a part of Asian Modeling Exercise (AME). The scenarios presented have been modeled by using a global TIMES-VTT energy system model, which is based on the IEA-ETSAP TIMES energy system modeling framework and the global ETSAP-TIAM model. Our scenario results indicate that the impacts of accelerated energy demand in the non-OECD Asia has a relatively small impact on the global marginal costs of greenhouse gas abatement. However, with the accelerated demand projections, the average per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the OECD were decreased while China, India, and South-East Asia increased their per capita greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that the costs of the greenhouse gas abatement would especially increase in the OECD region, if developing Asian countries increase their final energy consumption more rapidly than expected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The UK's 2008 Climate Change Act sets a legally binding target for reducing territorial greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels. Four pathways to achieve this target have been developed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, with all pathways requiring increased us of bioenergy. A significant amount of this could be indigenously sourced from crops, but will increased domestic production of energy crops conflict with other agricultural priorities?To address this question, a coupled analysis of the UK energy system and land use has been developed. The two systems are connected by the production of bioenergy, and are projected forwards in time under the energy pathways, accounting for various constraints on land use for agriculture and ecosystem services. The results show different combinations of crop yield and compositions for the pathways lead to the appropriation of between 7% and 61% of UK's agricultural land for bioenergy production. This could result in competition for land for food production and other land uses, as well as indirect land use change in other countries due to an increase in bioenergy imports. Consequently, the potential role of bioenergy in achieving UK emissions reduction targets may face significant deployment challenges.},

The aim of the presented study is to assess the different biomass options against the background of energy and environmental political targets based on a system analytical approach for the future German energy sector. The results show that heat generation and to a lower extent combined heat and power (CHP) production from solid biomass like wood and straw are the most cost effective ways to contribute to the emission reduction targets. The use of energy crops in fermentation biogas plants (maize) and for production of 1st generation transportation fuels, like biodiesel from rapeseed and ethanol from grain or sugar beet, are less favourable.

It is based on the modified energy flow optimization model (EFOM) and minimizes total costs in planning capacities of power plants and CCS to be added, stripped or retrofitted. In the process, it reduces risks due to a high volatility in fuel prices; it also provides robustness against infeasibility with respect to meeting the required emission level by adopting a penalty constant that corresponds to the price level of emission allowances. In this manner, the proposed methodology enables decision makers to determine the optimal capacities of power plants and/or CCS, as well as volumes of emissions trading in the future that will meet the required emission level and satisfy energy demand from various user-sections with minimum costs and maximum robustness. They can also gain valuable insights on the effects that the price of emission allowances has on the competitiveness of RES and CCS technologies; it may be used in, for example, setting appropriate subsidies and tax policies for promoting greater use of these technologies.

Results show that for the power sector SO2 emissions will be very low for scenarios that include large scale implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The annual emissions of NOx are estimated to be lower in all scenarios with greenhouse gas reductions. However, applying the post-combustion technology on existing power plants may result in higher NOx emissions per kWh. Both SO2 and NOx emissions from the power sector are a substantial part of the current national total. Large scale implementation of the post-combustion CO2 capture technology may result in more than 5 times higher NH3 emissions compared to scenarios without CCS and to other capture options (i.e. pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion). Particulate Matter (PM) emissions are lower in the scenarios with CO2 reduction. A scenario with large scale implementation of the oxyfuel technology shows the lowest emissions of PM. In the scenarios with post-combustion capture Non Methane Volatile Organic Compounds emissions may increase due to the emission of solvents used in the capture process. The main conclusion is that climate policy and air quality policy are entwined and may result in synergies and trade-offs. Quantification of these synergies and trade-offs however encompasses inaccuracies due to data uncertainty and knowledge gaps. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An energy system transition in the European Union is required to meet the decarbonisation targets determined in the Paris Agreement. To realise this transition, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050 is required. However, ambitions are being raised towards carbon neutrality. Such transition will likely imply deep changes across all sectors of the EU economies and societies. The impacts on these sectors need to be analysed with a multi-disciplinary approach, to unveil cross-sectoral risks and opportunities of the transition. Additionally, the pace and effectiveness of the transition may be affected by technical and economic drivers within the EU. In this paper, we soft-link three modelling frameworks specialised in assessing technology transitions, spatially-disaggregated health impacts of air pollutants and economic impacts and we apply them to the study of deep decarbonisation pathways for the EU. An energy system model, TIMES PanEU, is soft linked with an impact assessment model, EcoSense, and with a general equilibrium model, NEWAGE. The application looks at three clearly distinguished but likely paths: one where the decarbonisation effort is mostly undertaken by decarbonisation of the energy supply; one where consumers take on a more active role in the decarbonisation, instead; one where ambitions are raised and all sectors of the economy must act together to achieve the targets. In the specific application, it is concluded that 80% reduction is achievable with a decentralised, demand driven system as well as with a centralised one, where the decarbonisation effort mainly comes from the supply side. On the other hand, to achieve a more ambitious reduction target, a broader technology mix and also the effort from both supply and demand side will be required. The synergy between the sectors, especially for the utilisation of the domestic sources such as biomass, will be a decisive factor for the direction of the energy transition.},

The existing and new power generation technologies evaluated included 34 centralized and 8 dispersed power generation technologies in the residential and commercial energy demand sectors. To take into account the varieties of useful energy and of its demand duration patterns among entities in the demand sectors, the hourly mean power and heating and cooling demand-supply balances in one residential and four commercial representative entities were considered for each month. The road transport sector addressed five types of automotive use. The useful-energy demands are exogenously given; the model calculates the technology installations that satisfy the demands to minimize the total systems cost for each year up to 2030. The availability of the new technologies, i.e., the first years they are installable, is derived from research and development (R&D) process analyses on the basis of surveys to experts. As a result of the model calculation, dispersed molten carbonate and solid oxide fuel cells and onboard gasoline reforming-type fuel cell vehicle (FCV) technologies are expected to have the largest economic values, approximately 60-120 billion constant 1998 yen [460-920 million U.S. dollars (USD)] among the evaluated new CO2-reduction technologies.

abstract = {Low emission and green hydrogen as a carbon-free energy carrier has attracted worldwide attention in decarbonizing the energy system and meeting the Paris agreement target of limiting warming to 2 °C or below. This study investigates the contribution of different hydrogen pathways to the energy transition and sheds light on adopting different decarbonization scenarios for Quebec, Canada, while including biogenic emissions from forest-based biomass consumption. We assess various alternative policy scenarios using a TIMES model for North America (NATEM), a bottom-up techno-economic approach. This study examines the role of various hydrogen pathways in Quebec's energy transition by considering different net-zero policy scenarios and an additional set of “green” scenarios, which prohibit the use of fossil fuel-based hydrogen. The results show that varying the penetration of hydrogen provides a key trade-off between reliance on direct air capture, reliance on carbon storage, reliance on wind and solar buildout, the inter-sector allocation of residual emissions, and the overall cost of achieving emission targets. In particular, the use of hydrogen in the industrial sector, a sector known to be difficult to decarbonize, reduces industrial emissions and reliance on direct air capture (DAC). Clustering industrial plants to use captured CO2 as a feedstock for synthetic fuel production may not reduce industrial GHG emissions by 2050, but it offers the opportunity to use captured CO2 instead of sequestering it in deep saline aquifers. Even though increasing industrial green hydrogen penetration increases marginal GHG abatement costs in the green net-zero scenario by 2050, it further minimizes industrial GHG emissions and the need for DAC among all net-zero scenarios by 2050. Hydrogen plays a significant role in achieving ambitious net-zero emission target, especially where electrification is not feasible, or electricitystorage is required.},

A detailed modeling of different forest-based bioenergy pathways is provided following a techno-economic (bottom-up) approach. As an illustration, these pathways are implemented in NATEM-Qu{\'{e}}bec, a detailed bottom-up energy model for Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. It is the first time different primary and secondary forest-based bioenergy technologies are being modeled in such a detailed bottom-up energy system model like TIMES. A detailed analysis of forest-based bioenergy potential in Quebec is also provided under different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction scenarios. Main insights are as follows. The transportation sector is the primary contributor to GHG emissions over the time horizon in all scenarios, except for the most stringent GHG reduction scenario (GHGB) in 2050. The industrial sector is the main emitter by 2050 in GHGB, indicating the difficulties to decarbonize heavy industry. Furthermore, an extensive electrification is required to reach the GHG reduction targets. The bioenergy share is expected to increase considerably in the transportation and industrial sectors, cutting down on the need to reduce GHG emissions. Forest-based bioenergies such as cellulosic bioethanol, biobased heat, FT diesel and electricity as a co-product can effectively support this energy transition. The present study discerns forest-based bioenergies as an attainable decarbonization pathway for the province of Quebec and envisages a greater penetration of bioenergy than in the 2030 Plan for a Green Economy proposed by the government of Qu{\'{e}}bec. Other world regions with a declining trend for traditional forest products should also consider such a strategy.},

We applied this model to the case of France and built contrasted scenarios, from 0% to 100% renewable energy penetration by 2050. We also tested different assumptions on Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) production, imports, demand flexibility and biomass potential.

abstract = {A need to make substantial future reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would require major changes in national energy systems. Nine industrialized countries have explored the technical boundaries of CO2 emission restrictions during the next 40 to 50 years using comparable scenario assumptions and a standard model, MARKAL. Quantitative results for the countries are shown side by side in a set of energy maps that compare the least-cost evolution of the national energy systems by the main factors that contribute to CO2 emissions. The ability to restrict future CO2 emissions and the most cost-effective measures for doing so differ among the countries; an international agreement that would mandate substantial emission restrictions among countries by an equal percentage reduction is clearly impossible. The results are a first step toward a basis for allocating such international reductions, and the multinational process by which they were produced provides an example for further international greenhouse gas abatement costing studies.},

abstract = {Energy system models can contribute in evaluating impacts of energy and climate policies. The process of working with energy system models assists the understanding of the quantita¬tive relationships between different parts of the energy system and between different time periods, under various assumptions. With the aim of improving the ability of national energy system models to provide robust and transparent input to the decision-making process, a three-step energy modelling process is introduced based on the literature on system analysis and energy modelling. This process is then used to address five different research questions, which are based on (but not identical to) six embedded papers. In the first step (step 1) the ‘real' system is simplified and conceptualised into a model, where the main components and parameters of a problem are represented. In order to attain robust results, it is important to focus not only on what needs to be included in the model, but also on what can be left out. In order not to add noise to the analysis, there is a trade-off between what is desired and what can be included in terms of data. In the second step (step 2), all assumptions are sorted within a mathematical model and the algorithms solved. The structure of the model is found crucial for the possibility to trace the results back to the assumptions (transparency). In the last step (step 3), the model results are interpreted together with aspects not captured in the model (e.g. non-economic preferences, institutional barriers), and discussed in relation to the direct assumptions provided to the model (step 1) and to the implicit assumptions due to the choice of model (step 2). All three steps are essential in order to achieve robust and transparent policy analyses, and all three steps contribute to the learning about the ‘real' system.The embedded papers (Paper I-VI) deal with issues of particular relevance for long-term analysis of the Swedish energy system. The results of Paper I illustrate the importance of capturing the seasonal and daily variations when representing cross-border trade of electricity in national models; a too simplified representation will make the model overestimate the need for installed power capacity in Sweden. Paper II presents a methodology for estimating the ‘useful demand' for heating and cooling based on national statistics, which is useful as most energy system models are driven by ‘useful demand', while national statistics are based on the measurable ‘final energy consumption'. Paper III compares the technical potential of com-bined heat and power (CHP) from different approaches and calculates the economic potential of CHP using a European energy system model (EU-TIMES). The comparison the technical potential of the different approaches reveals differences in definitions of the potential as well as in the system boundary. The resulting economic potential of CHP in year 2030 is shown to be significantly higher compared to today's level, even though conservative assumptions regarding district heating were used. Paper IV assesses the impacts of district heating on the future Swedish energy system, first by a quantitative analysis using TIMES-Sweden and then by discussing aspects that cannot be captured by the model. Paper V compares different climate target scenarios and examines the impacts on the resulting total system cost with and without the addition of ancillary benefits of reductions in domestic air-pollution. The results reflect the fact that carbon dioxide emission reductions abroad imply a lost opportunity of achieving substantial domestic welfare gains from the reductions of regional and local environmental pollutants. Paper VI presents and discusses an iteration procedure for soft-linking a national energy system model (TIMES-Sweden) with a national CGE model (EMEC). Some aspects of the way in which we perform the soft-linking are not standard in the literature (e.g., the use of direction-specific connection points). By applying the iteration process, the resulting carbon emissions were found to be lower than when the models are used separately.},

abstract = {It is increasingly recognised that GHG reduction policies can have important ancillary benefits in the form of positive local and regional environmental impacts. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the domestic ancillary pollution benefits of climate policy in Sweden, and investigate how these are affected by different climate policy designs. The latter differ primarily in terms of how the country chooses to meet a specific target and where the necessary emission reductions take place. The analysis relies on simulations within the energy system optimisation model TIMES-Sweden, and focuses on four non-GHG pollutants: Nitrogen Oxides (NOX), Non Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC), inhalable particles (PM2.5), and Sulphur dioxide (SO2). The simulations permit detailed assessments of the respective technology and fuel choices that underlie any net changes in the estimated ancillary effects. The results indicate that the ancillary benefits constitute a far from insignificant share of total system costs, and this share appears to be highest in the scenarios that entail the largest emission reductions domestically. This result reflects the fact that carbon dioxide emission reductions abroad also implies a lost opportunity of achieving substantial domestic welfare gain from the reductions of regional and local environmental pollutants. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop a method for how to soft-link a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with a energy system model. The central research question is how the interaction between modellers and models can, both qualitatively and quantitatively, enable and facilitate a transparent energy and climate policy decision-making process at the national level. The paper describes this development in detail, and presents and discusses the results of the soft-linking methodology applied to a climate scenario. Important similarities and differences between two Swedish models, i.e. EMEC (a CGE model) and TIMES-Sweden (an energy system model), are identified. These findings are used to develop a robust and transparent method to translate simulation results between the two models, resulting in intermediate ‘translation models' between EMEC and TIMES-Sweden. EMEC provides demand input to TIMES, while TIMES provides feedback on the energy efficiency parameters, the energy mix, and the prices of electricity and heat. These ‘translations' can also be used stand-alone to feed into other energy system models. The presented soft-linking process demonstrates the importance of linking an energy system model with a macroeconomic model when studying energy and climate policy. With the same exogenous parameters, the soft-linking between the models results in a new picture of the economy and the energy system in 2035 compared with the corresponding model results in the absence of soft-linking. The study also leads to a better understanding of how the models can interact while preserving the respective models' strengths, to give an improved picture of both the flows in the economy and the impact of energy policy instruments.},

Moreover, the proposed soft-linking methodology is applied in the context of a climate policy scenario for Sweden. The results display a partly new description of the Swedish economy, which when soft-linking, generates lower CO2-emissions in the reference scenario due to a decline in industrial energy demand.

Using a world scale, full energy system, bottom-up, optimization model (Global MARKAL Model - GMM) we address the possibility of supporting the fuel cell vehicle technology to become competitive in the markets. In a series of optimizations we evaluate the potential influence of governmental supports and the internalization of externalities related to CO2 and local pollution emissions originating from the transportation sector, as well as preferential crediting options and demonstration projects promoting fuel cell vehicles. The results suggest that the crucial element is the price of fuel cells and their further potential to reduce costs.

However, the existing energy models do not account for these ‘take or pay' contracts for investigating climate policies. In this context, this paper investigates the impact of these power purchase agreements on power sector operations, cost of electricity and emissions from the Indian power sector. An optimization model was developed for this study with 620 coal, 239 gas, 21 nuclear and 686 hydro units with technology and operational characteristics to analyze electricity dispatch for power sector. The operations of thermal power plants were analyzed with and without power purchase agreements, and low carbon policy scenario. The scenarios are compared for power plant operations, cost of electricity, stranded assets, and emissions. The results show that there is a significant cost advantage for plants covered under power purchase agreements which favors the operations of older inefficient power plants in baseline scenarios. In addition, the representation of power purchase agreements raises the cost of electricity by 26 percent. A change in operating strategy from least cost to least emissions with a lower demand growth scenario can mitigate 24 percent emissions. The cost of carbon abatement is 268–277 USD/tonne for policy scenarios. Options like renegotiation of power purchase agreements can be considered to mitigate emissions.},

abstract = {There is a worldwide interest in renewable electricity technologies (RETs) due to growing concerns about global warming and climate change. As an EU candidate country whose energy demand increases exponentially, Turkey inevitably shares this common interest on RET. This study, using an aggregate economic equilibrium model, explores the economic costs of different policy measures to mitigate CO2 emissions in Turkey. The model combines energy demands, capital requirements and labor inputs at a constant elasticity of substitution under an economy-wide nested production function. Growing energy demand, triggered by economic growth, is met by increased supply and initiates new capacity additions. Investment into RET is encouraged via the incorporation of (a) endogenous technological learning through which the RET cost declines as a function of cumulative capacity, and (b) a willingness to pay (WTP) function which imposes the WTP of consumers as a lower bound on RET installation. The WTP equation is obtained as a function of consumer income categories, based on data gathered from a pilot survey in which the contingent valuation methodology was employed. The impacts of various emission reduction scenarios on GDP growth and RET diffusion are explored. As expected, RET penetration is accelerated under faster technological learning and higher WTP conditions. It is found that stabilizing CO2 emissions to year 2005 levels causes economic losses amounting to 17% and 23% of GDP in the years 2020 and 2030, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Price uncertainty is introduced through stochastic processes for the average wholesale price of electricity and for input fuel prices. Demand for electricity is assumed to be increasingly price-sensitive, as the electricity market deregulation proceeds, reflecting new options of consumers to react to electricity price changes (such as time-of-use pricing, unbundled electricity services, and choice of supplier). The empirical analysis is based on data for the Turkish electricity supply industry. Apart from general implications for policy-making, it provides some interesting insights about the impact of uncertainty and technical change on the diffusion of various emerging renewable energy technologies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The size of TM is such that non-linear (NL) optimal solutions cannot be obtained even when the best available personal computers and solvers are used. Therefore, an alternative is proposed based on decomposition methods converting TM to a small-size NL macroeconomic model, called TIAM-MACRO Stand-Alone (TMSA), and where the energy model TIAM is substituted by appropriate quadratic cost-supply functions (QSF). The TIAM model and the TMSA are calibrated to the demands estimated with a scenario generator and are then solved iteratively. This report concentrates on the description and foundation of the algorithm and explains why an adjusted production function is needed to allow for sectoral income and price elasticities that reproduce/calibrate the baseline scenario. It is shown that the decomposed problem for a single region is calibrated and solved to exactly the same results as the original problem in 3 min of computer time instead of 2–3 h without decomposition. Also, for the first time, we are able to solve the global TM model with 15 regions in 1.5 h applying the approach based on TMSA (in Windows 7, 64-bit workstation, solution in a single thread).},

We model a specific formulation of such a TTP where donor countries finance via carbon tax revenues, the diffusion of carbon-free technologies in developing countries (DCs) and quantify its benefits. Industrialized countries profit from increased technology exports, global diffusion of advanced technology (leading to additional technology learning and cost reductions) and reduced climate damages through the likelihood of greater global participation in a new international agreement. DCs experience increased welfare from access to subsidized technology, and profit from the reduction of damages related to climate change and expected secondary benefits of carbon abatement (such as reduced local and regional air pollution). The analysis identifies potential candidate technologies that could be supported under a TTP, and the impact of a TTP on economic development (including the flow of transfer subsidies) and global emissions. Although a TTP may encourage additional participation, such a proposal is only likely to be successful if an increased willingness to pay to avoid climate damages is accepted, first by the present and future generations of the industrialized world and later on, when sufficient economic growth is accumulated, by today's developing countries. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The modelling framework relies on the technico-economic model TIMES-Spain, part of the Pan-European TIMES model used in the project. TIMES is a bottom-up technology rich optimisation model representing the whole energy systems of the countries. Among the results, it appears that the gap regarding the renewable deployment in Spain between the Business-as-Usual case (including the existing policies) and the EU Directive should be compensated mainly by the penetration of bioenergy in transport and industry, and by the implementation of conservation measures, which contribute to reduce the total energy demand and thus makes useless additional investments in renewable power plants compared to the Business-as-Usual case. Only higher climate mitigation ambitions result in an absolute increase in the renewable-based electricity generation compared to the Business-as-Usual case. Moreover, when allowed, Spain is offering renewable energy credits under the statistical transfer mechanism to other European countries. The cost increase of the modelled renewable and climate policies compared to the Business-as-Usual remains relatively minor. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In order to assess climate mitigation agreements, we propose an iterative procedure linking TIAM-WORLD, a global technology-rich optimization model, and GEMINI-E3, a global general equilibrium model. The coupling methodology combines the precise representation of energy and technology choices with a coherent representation of the macro-economic impacts, especially in terms of trade effects of climate policies on energy-intensive products. In climate mitigation scenarios, drastic technology breakthroughs are required as soon as possible, especially in large emitting countries, and in all sectors of the economy. Energy-intensive industries tend to be delocalized in regions where low-carbon production is feasible and cheap, or in regions without emission cap. However, emission leakage remains small, mainly due to global lower oil demand, and energy exporting countries are extremely penalized given lower energy exports. Emission reduction at least in the power sector and in energy-intensive industries of developing countries must be considered to reach the 2°C target. },

In this paper, we analyze the impacts of changes in future temperature on the heating and cooling services both in terms of global and regional energy impacts and macro-economic effects. For this purpose, the technico-economic TIMES-WORLD and the general equilibrium GEMINI-E3 model are coupled with a climate model, PLASIM-ENTS, to assess the regional and seasonal temperature changes and their consequences on the energy and economic systems. One of the main insight of the analysis is the absence of climate feedback induced by the adaptation of the energy system to future heating and cooling needs, since the latter represent a limited share of total final energy consumption and emissions, and the heating and cooling changes tend to compensate each other, at the global level. However, significant changes may be observed at regional levels, more particularly in terms of additional power capacity required to satisfy the new cooling demands. In terms of macro-economic impacts, welfare gains comes from the decrease of energy for heating and to welfare loss due to an increase of electricity for space cooling.

abstract = {The energy sector is not only a major contributor to greenhouse gases, it is also vulnerable to climate change and will have to adapt to future climate conditions. The objective of this study is to analyze the impacts of changes in future temperatures on the heating and cooling services of buildings and the resulting energy and macro-economic effects at global and regional levels. For this purpose, the techno-economic TIAM-WORLD (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model) and the general equilibrium GEMINI-E3 (General Equilibrium Model of International-National Interactions between Economy, Energy and Environment) models are coupled with a climate model, PLASIM-ENTS (Planet-Simulator- Efficient Numerical Terrestrial Scheme). The key results are as follows. At the global level, the climate feedback induced by adaptation of the energy system to heating and cooling is found to be insignificant, partly because heating and cooling-induced changes compensate and partly because they represent a limited share of total final energy consumption. However, significant changes are observed at regional levels, more particularly in terms of additional power capacity required to satisfy additional cooling services, resulting in increases in electricity prices. In terms of macro-economic impacts, welfare gains and losses are associated more with changes in energy exports and imports than with changes in energy consumption for heating and cooling. The rebound effect appears to be non-negligible. To conclude, the coupling of models of different nature was successful and showed that the energy and economic impacts of climate change on heating and cooling remain small at the global level, but changes in energy needs will be visible at more local scale.},

abstract = {This paper explores the impacts of long-term technology and climate uncertainties on the optimal evolution of the World energy system. Stochastic programming with the TIAM-World model is used for a parametric analysis of hedging strategies, varying the probabilities associated to each of two contrasted technology outlooks. The parametric analysis constitutes an original supplement to the computation of hedging strategies by identifying technologies that are robust under a broad range of probabilities of the two technology outlooks. Natural gas appears to be one of the most appealing robust options in an uncertain technological context, especially in China, given its relatively low emissions and the low capital cost of associated technologies. Natural gas and some other options are in fact considered as "super-hedging" actions, penetrating more in the hedging solution than in any of the deterministic scenarios. Nuclear power and CCS use are less robust: they depend much more on either the level of the climate target or the probabilities of the technology outlooks. The analysis also shows that technological uncertainty has a greater impact under milder climate targets than under more severe ones. Future research might consider a larger set of possible technology outlooks, as well as specific analyses focused on key characteristics of low-carbon technologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In order to study the conditions for a World self-enforcing agreement on climate change, we model cooperative and non-cooperative World climate strategies with an integrated version of the 15-region techno-economic MARKAL model in which abatement costs and climate related damages are both included. We first explain why the use of a technology oriented model may add value to the analysis of global GHG strategies. Based on the empirical finding of linear cumulative climate damages, the computation of Nash equilibrium can be reduced to solving a series of 15 independent linear programs, one per region. Moreover, assuming interregional transfers to share the global surplus of cooperation, our work adopts the point of view of dynamic partial equilibrium computation coupled with cooperative game-theoretic principles. The results illustrate how the non-cooperative strategy is closer to the base case than to the cooperative strategy, and the amount of side-payments sufficient to guarantee the stability of the cooperative strategy are calculated with four different rules. The internal (in)stability of farsighted coalitions without transfers (non-cooperation) is also analyzed. The current project appears to be the first one of the sort using a large and detailed technology explicit model such as MARKAL. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {The partial equilibriumtechnology rich global 15-regionTIMES Integrated Assessment Model (TIAM) is used to assess climate policies in a very uncertain world. Stochastic optimizations are run with four possible climate sensitivities and two development rates, and full resolution of uncertainties in 2040. These assumptions are in line with those of the Energy Modeling Forum. While a 3˚C target – for both the peak and the long term equilibrium temperatures – is achievable atmoderate cost, the smallest achievable temperature increase is close to 1.9˚C, albeit at a very large cost. More severe temperature targets would require additional CO2 abatement potential that is currently not yet seen as realistic. The more detailed analysis of the optimal hedging strategy with a 2.5˚C target reveals that hydroelectricity, sequestration by forests and CH4/N2O reduction are optimal early robust actions. However, nuclear plants and capture and storage of CO2 do not belong to robust abatement strategies. Moreover, the uncertainty on the GDP growth rates has very little impact on robust decisions. Finally, no perfect forecast strategy is able to reproduce the hedging strategy, hence the relevance of using stochastic programming. Sensitivity analyses are undertaken on: the date of resolution of uncertainties, the ex- ogenous radiative forcing, the very long term emissions, the price elasticities of demands, and nuclear development.},

abstract = {The well-known method of stochastic programming in extensive form is used on the large scale, partial equilibrium, technology rich global 15-region TIMES Integrated Assessment Model (ETSAP-TIAM), to assess climate policies in a very uncertain world. The main uncertainties considered are those of the Climate Sen- sitivity parameter, and of the rate of economic development. In this research, we argue that the stochastic programming approach is well adapted to the treatment of major uncertainties, in spite of the limitation inherent to this technique due to increased model size when many outcomes are modeled. The main advantage of the approach is to obtain a single hedging strategy while uncertainty prevails, con- trary to classical scenario analysis. Furthermore, the hedging strategy has the very desirable property of attenuating the (in)famous ‘razor edge' effect of Linear Pro- gramming, and thus to propose a more robust mix of technologies to attain the de- sired climate target. Although the examples treated use the classical expected cost criterion, the paper also presents, and argues in favor of, altering this criterion to introduce risk considerations, by means of a linearized semi-variance term, or by using the Savage criterion. Risk considerations are arguably even more important in situations where the random events are of a ‘one-shot' nature and involve large costs or payoffs, as is the case in the modeling of global climate strategies. The ar- ticle presents methodological details of the modeling approach, and uses realistic instances of the ETSAP-TIAM model to illustrate the technique and to analyze the resulting hedging strategies. The instances modeled and analyzed assume several alternative global temperature targets ranging from less than 2◦C to 3◦C. The 2.5 C},

Firstly, the relevant policy questions the decision makers want answered were revealed in the course of the Forum process. Secondly, the extent to which the existing models can provide meaningful answers to these questions was explored. In the end, it was established that neither of the two existing models is well suited to representing uncertainties or finding robust strategies under deep uncertainty. As models depicting a radical system change over the next 50-100 years must necessarily deal with deep uncertainties, new research methodologies are needed to improve adaptive policy making.},

To achieve such a target, it is necessary to diffuse innovative technologies with the capacity to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To that end, the ripple effect of diffusing innovative technologies on the energy and environment must be quantitatively analyzed using an energy system analysis model such as the MARKAL (Market Allocation) model. However, energy system analysis models based on an optimization methodology have certain limitations in that a technology with superior cost competitiveness dominates the whole market and non-cost factors cannot be considered. Therefore, this study proposes a new methodology for overcoming problems associated with the use of MARKAL models, by interfacing with a forecasting model based on the discrete-choice model. The new methodology was applied to green car technology to verify its usefulness and to study the ripple effects of green car technology on greenhouse gas reduction. The results of this study can be used as a reference when establishing a strategy for effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, and could be of assistance to future studies using the energy system analysis model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: Bioenergy is a key component of climate change mitigation strategies aiming at low stabilization. Its versatility and capacity to generate negative emissions when combined with carbon capture and storage add degrees of freedom to the timing of emission reductions. This paper aims to explore the robustness of a bioenergy-based mitigation strategy by addressing several dimensions of uncertainty on biomass potential, bioenergy use and induced land use change emissions. Design/methodology/approach: Different mitigation scenarios were explored by two different energy-economy optimization models coupled to the same land use model, which provides a common basis for the second generation bioenergy dynamics in the two energy-economy models. Findings: Using bioenergy is found to be a robust mitigation strategy as demonstrated by high biomass shares in primary energy demand in both models and in all mitigation scenarios. Practical implications: A variety of possible storylines about future uses of biomass exist. The comparison of the technology choices preferred by the applied models helps understand how future emission reductions can be achieved under alternative storylines. Originality/value: The presented comparison-based assessment goes beyond other comparison studies because both energy-economy models are coupled to the same land use model.},

abstract = {With advances in natural gas extraction technologies, there is an increase in the availability of domestic natural gas, and natural gas is gaining a larger share of use as a fuel in electricity production. At the power plant, natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel than coal, but uncertainties exist in the amount of methane leakage occurring upstream in the extraction and production of natural gas. At higher leakage levels, the additional methane emissions could offset the carbon dioxide emissions reduction benefit of switching from coal to natural gas. This analysis uses the MARKAL linear optimization model to compare the carbon emissions profiles and system-wide global warming potential of the U.S. energy system over a series of model runs in which the power sector is required to meet a specific carbon dioxide reduction target across a number of scenarios in which the availability of natural gas changes. Scenarios are run with carbon dioxide emissions and a range of upstream methane emission leakage rates from natural gas production along with upstream methane and carbon dioxide emissions associated with production of coal and oil. While the system carbon dioxide emissions are reduced in most scenarios, total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions show an increase in scenarios in which natural gas prices remain low and, simultaneously, methane emissions from natural gas production are higher.},

This paper presents a global scenario analysis using the energy system optimization model EUROfusion TIMES to analyze the possible future role of fusion according to three different technologies and using capacity curves based on historical trends for the electricity sector. The analyzed fusion options are based on ARC, EU-DEMO and Asian-DEMO reactor concepts, characterized in terms of techno-economic features according to publicly available literature and considering a set of educated growth rate for their penetration. Results concerning installed capacity trends and contribution to the electricity mix are presented up to 2100 in three socio-economic storylines and for different scenarios considering either the availability of competing technologies or delays in the development of fusion plants. Despite not contributing at all to the energy transition in Europe and the US, fusion may gain share in contexts characterized by highly growing electricity demand, contributing to satisfy stringent environmental constraints together with other low-carbon technologies in the second half of the century.},

An important tool in building long-term environmental strategies is scenario analysis, often built through quantitative bottom-up models, among which the TIMES model generator. However, the quality of the results strongly depends on the level of detail of the dataset it can rely on. Therefore, the development of insightful environmental-friendly energy use trajectories is favored by the use of a sufficiently rich and accurately built technological repository. A review of the technological outlook is presented in this paper in five industrial subsectors (iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, non-metallic minerals, chemicals, pulp and paper). That review leads to the composition of a dataset (referred to as industrial demand technology database) including both currently existing and announced technologies to be used in a variety of macro-scale energy models, with particular reference to those belonging to the TIMES family. Techno-economic and environmental parameters are critically selected from the available data sources, in order to give a picture of the degree of sustainability that each industrial sector can achieve in the long term. This is a first-of-a-kind comprehensive review – including, among others, the characterization of very innovative technologies still in research phase – and as such, it could be very helpful to develop useful insights focusing on a low carbon, sustainable energy system development.},

First, the EUROfusion TIMES Model is used to assess the sensitivity of different long-term evolutions of the European energy system, with particular reference to the road transport sector, considering different trends for the prescribed future variations of investment cost and vehicle efficiency. In a second step, the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis is used to critically evaluate the alternative optimal configurations proposed by the model simulations under a set of economic and environmental criteria. The results of the analysis allow the discussion of the influence of such criteria on the different alternative cases, complementing the cost minimization approach.

ETM is a minimum-cost energy system model aimed at investigating the conditions for the introduction of nuclear fusion in the future electricity mix. The most interesting ETM long-run scenarios (until 2100) must comply with stringent environmental targets to pursue the Below-2-Degrees objective, identified in the Paris Agreement, allowing wide commercial adoption of innovative production processes - currently under test or research - which would almost completely replace well-established fossil-based industrial techniques in the iron and steel, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, non-metallic minerals and pulp and paper sub-sectors. Among them, low-carbon and electrolysis-based processes could open the way to a considerable increase of electricity demand, requiring also clean resources not to undermine sectoral efforts in becoming more environmentally sustainable, and the same does the implementation of CCS technologies. The study shows that the industrial sector contributes to the energy mix decarbonization by relying on CCS technologies, when available, or new low-carbon technologies. The progressive electrification of the industrial sector turns into an increasing final electricity demand which is covered by renewables and nuclear when stringent climate policies are put in place. Despite technological constraints are likely to slow down fusion deployment in the future, a range of scenarios show that nuclear fusion could contribute to generation of carbon-free electricity in the future European energy system.},

abstract = {The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is increasingly used to ensure environmental sustainability of emerging biofuels. However, LCA studies are usually not performed at the process design stage, when it would be more efficient to identify and control environmental aspects. Moreover, the long-term economic profitability of biofuels depends on future energy and climate policies, which are usually not considered in techno-economic feasibility studies. This paper combines the LCA method and a TIMES energy system model, to offer a simultaneous assessment of potential environmental impacts and market penetration under different energy and climate policy scenarios of emerging energy pathways. This combined approach is applied to butanol produced from pre-hydrolysate in a Canadian Kraft dissolving pulp mill. Indeed, the integration of biorefinery processes into existing pulp and paper mills has been identified as a promising avenue to maintain mills activities. It could increase and diversify revenues, keep the forestry-based communities alive, and potentially mitigate climate change by replacing fossil-based fuels or products. Results show that (1) the energy efficiency of the butanol production process is a critical aspect to consider in future design and implementation steps in order to make butanol a competitive fuel among all other alternative fuels, (2) with a 50% internal heat recovery, butanol has a role to play in the transportation sector under climate policy scenarios, and may have a lower carbon footprint than gasoline as estimated by a 2010 US EPA study, and (3) higher supply costs for feedstock might undermine the competitiveness of butanol on the medium term (2030), but probably not on the long-term (2050). This combination of assessment methods is replicable to analyze any types of emerging energy pathways in Canada and in other countries, and to help designing more sustainable forest biorefinery processes in other countries with important forest sector.},

We apply the model to address state-scale impacts of a renewable electricity standard (RES) and a carbon tax in one southeastern state, Georgia. Biomass is the lowest cost option for large-scale renewable generation in Georgia; we find that electricity can be generated from biomass co-firing at existing coal plants for a marginal cost above baseline of 0.2-2.2. cents/kWh and from dedicated biomass facilities for 3.0-5.5. cents/kWh above baseline. We evaluate the cost and amount of renewable electricity that would be produced in-state and the amount of out-of-state renewable electricity credits (RECs) that would be purchased as a function of the REC price. We find that in Georgia, a constant carbon tax to 2030 primarily promotes a shift from coal to natural gas and does not result in substantial renewable electricity generation. We also find that the option to offset a RES with renewable electricity credits would push renewable investment out-of-state. The tradeoff for keeping renewable investment in-state by not offering RECs is an approximately 1% additional increase in the levelized cost of electricity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In recent years, several countries have launched plans to eliminate liquid vehicles. To study the prospective impacts of the elimination policies for liquid vehicles, this research applies Global TIMES to model the large-scale popularization of electric vehicles worldwide in 6 scenarios with various elimination plans. The results show that if the prohibition policies are implemented between 2025 and 2035, energy consumption of the global transport sector will decrease by 56.0% and direct carbon emissions will decline by 84.4% in 2050 compared to the reference scenario. Furthermore, decarbonization of the power sector is crucial to mitigate indirect carbon emissions from the transport electricity use. To keep the sum of cumulative direct and indirect carbon emissions of the transport sector from 2010 to 2050 within the 2 °C limit, the carbon intensity of the power sector should decrease to 370 t/GWh, 255 t/GWh and 45 t/GWh by 2040 when countries will implement the prohibition policies from 2025 to 2035, 2030 to 2040 and 2035 to 2045, respectively. Toward the 1.5 °C target, decarbonization of the power sector should be much more radical and more actions will be essential. Electrification of the transport sector should begin even earlier (electrification rate exceeds 10% by 2020) and transport turnover should drop by more than 15% by 2050 compared to the reference scenario.},

abstract = {Deep decarbonisation of the electricity sector is central to achieving the United Kingdom's (UK) climate policy targets for 2050 and meeting its international commitments under the Paris Agreement. While the overall strategy for decarbonising the energy system has been well established in previous studies, there remain deep uncertainties around the total investment cost requirements for the power system. The future of the power system is of critical importance because low carbon electricity may create significant opportunities for emissions reduction in buildings and transport. A key policy application of quantitative analysis using models is to explore how much investment needs to be mobilised for the energy transition. However, past estimates of energy transition costs for the UK power sector have focused only on 2030 rather than 2050 and consider a relatively narrow range of uncertainties. This paper addresses this important research gap. The UK government's main whole system energy economy model is linked to a power system model that employs an advanced approach to uncertainty analysis, combining Monte Carlo simulation with Modelling-to-Generate Alternatives (MGA), producing 800 different scenario pathways. These pathways simultaneously consider uncertainties in policy, technology and costs. The results show that with No Climate Policy, installed generation capacities in 2050 are found in the range 60–75 GW, while under an 80% Reduction in GHG Emissions, between 100 GW and 130 GW of plant are required. Meeting climate targets for 2050 is also found to increase the investment requirements for new electricity generation. The interquartile range for cumulative investments in new generation under the No Climate Policy scenario ranges from {\pounds}60bn to {\pounds}75bn, while under an 80% Reduction in GHG Emissions, investment requirements approximately double to {\pounds}110bn - {\pounds}140bn. The exercise demonstrates the importance of uncertainty analysis to policy evaluation, yielding insights for future research practice both in the UK and internationally.},

To analyze changes in China's interprovincial coal transportation and corresponding emissions under China's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and Well Below 2 degrees target, this study develops a 30-province energy system optimization model (China TIMES-30P) to simulate three low carbon scenarios, including PEAK2030 (Emissions peak at 2030), PEAKA (Emissions peak before 2030) and WBD2 (Well below 2 degrees). The low carbon development will lead to the reduction of coal transportation to 1114,728 and 653 Mtce in 2050 (48%, 66% and 69% lower than the reference scenario) under the PEAK2030, PEAKA and WBD2 scenarios. Meanwhile, the overall coal transportation pattern will be simplified and concentrated. These will cause the decrease of the corresponding freight turnover to 1337, 887,787 billion tkm in 2050 (44%, 63%, 67% lower than the reference) under the PEAK2030, PEAKA and WBD2 scenarios, respectively. Moreover, low carbon transition will also promote the transformation of power generation structure, contributing to the drop of the emission per unit of freight turnover of coal transportation to 3.00, 1.61, 0.52 kt CO2/btkm in 2050 under the PEAK2030, PEAKA and WBD2 scenarios. Owing to the decrease of coal transportation amount, transportation distance and the emission coefficients of coal transportation, cumulative emissions from coal transportation for the period 2010 to 2050 are estimated to be 28%, 48% and 64% lower than the reference scenario in the PEAK2030, PEAKA and WBD2, respectively.},

From coal flow in 2010-2015, we found that the Xinjiang and Southwest region can be more developed to supply coal and the Middle region can be developed as a transit area for the Coastal region. From the perspective of provincial China-TIMES model, there will be a substantial growth of Southwest output while Xinjiang increase much slower due to the transportation cost in the Base scenario. Moreover, policies should strengthen the capability of the Middle region to supply energy for the Coastal area.},

abstract = {China has been the world's largest cement producer and the cement production has led to increased energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which greatly affect the country's social and economic development. In this paper, an integrated assessment framework was developed by combining the Stock-based model and the Integrated MARKAL–EFOM System model of China (China TIMES), and it was used in China's cement sector to simulate the trends of energy consumption and CO2 emissions during 2010–2050, under a reference scenario and three carbon tax scenarios. The modeling results show that: (1) the cement production in China will increase from 1.8 billion tons in 2010, to a peak of 2.5 billion tons in around 2017, and then gradually decrease to 1.5 billion tons in 2050; (2) Through the adoption of three alternative abatement measures (i.e., switching the fuel types, implementing the energy-efficient measures and CCS), China's cement sector could potentially achieve a great reduction in CO2 emissions; (3) In the near future, the cement sector's decarbonisation will mainly rely on energy efficiency improvement; while the use of alternative fuel use and CCS will be of great significance from a long-term perspective. Additionally, based on the modeling results, we build the energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies roadmap for China's cement sector.},

Based on the scenarios analysis of China TIMES model, this paper shows that carbon tax doesn't work significantly on the technology choice and CO2 emission reduction in the short term. However, in a long run, high carbon tax may increase the application of production with CCS or wasted heat recovery and cut down the small-and medium-sized plants. Moreover, tax on all industries acts more effectively than that only on the cement industry.},

Then this paper downscaled the population and GDP using the regression downscaling algorithm and projected the energy service demand of process and sector based on the methodology of China TIMES model. The energy service demand of building and transport would keep increasing and the industrial sector would reach a peak value and then decreasing.

abstract = {Hot water and space heating account for about 80% of total energy consumption in the residential sector in the UK. It is thus crucial to decarbonise residential heating to achieve UK's 2050 greenhouse gas reduction targets. However, the decarbonisation transitions determined by most techno-economic energy system models might be too optimistic or misleading for relying on cost minimisation alone and not considering households' preferences for different heating technologies. This study thus proposes a novel framework to incorporate heterogeneous households' (HHs) preferences into the modelling process of the UK TIMES model. The incorporated preferences for HHs are based on a nationwide survey on homeowners' choices of heating technologies. Preference constraints are then applied to regulate the HHs' choices of heating technologies to reflect the survey results. Consequently, compared to the least-cost transition pathway, the preference-driven pathway adopts heating technologies gradually without abrupt increases of market shares. Heat pumps and electric heaters are deployed much less than in the cost optimal result. Extensive district heating using low-carbon fuels and conservation measures should thus be deployed to provide flexibility for decarbonisation. The proposed framework can also incorporate preferences for other energy consumption technologies and be applied to other linear programming-based energy system models.},

abstract = {Demand-side flexibility from smart appliances and passenger electric vehicles has been increasingly regarded in recent years as an effective measure to reduce peak loads and to aid system balancing. While numerous studies have been undertaken to investigate the benefits of demand-side flexibility, most have either focused only on the power sector or provided a snapshot for a future year or day. The influence of interactions between sectors in the long-term under energy transition pathways has therefore been under explored. This paper presents a novel modelling approach in a whole energy systems model, UK TIMES, to investigate the benefits of demand-side flexibility from smart appliances and passenger electric vehicles, including the reduction in the costs of moving to a low carbon economy. This analysis shows that demand-side control increases system flexibility, enabling the integration of high levels of low carbon power, such as nuclear and wind, whilst reducing the requirements for storage. By 2050, the peak load is reduced by around 7 GW (9%), and cumulatively about 30.9 billion GBP saved with the help of this demand-side flexibility. This approach could be integrated into other energy systems models to improve the representation of this important flexibility mechanism.},

abstract = {Projections of future energy use in buildings are a crucial tool in the tracking and attainment of political targets for energy efficiency and climate gas mitigation. In this article, a new methodology for projecting both the final energy use and the peak power demand for the Norwegian building stock is presented. The novelty of the methodology is to combine a set of existing, previously documented models in a novel way that integrates building stock models, hourly energy demand load profiles, and energy system modelling. The result is a coherent long-term projection of both annual and hourly energy use for different energy carriers, presented here with four scenarios of final energy use. The results show an expected decrease in total energy use for the Norwegian building stock between −2 and −12 TWh towards 2050, corresponding to a −3% to −14% of the energy use in 2020. Models for projecting future energy use are helpful both to evaluate the potential effects of current policies and to help reveal the need for new or updated policies. However, to have the desired effect, the projections must be as realistic as possible and reflect the actual development in energy use in the building stock. This necessitates a methodology for evaluating historical long-term annual energy use projections to understand why some models succeed in predicting energy use development while others fail. In this article, a set of indicators for evaluating the calibration of different models are presented. The indicators evaluate the initial difference and the divergence in the annualised trend for energy use projection models, compared to statistical data. The indicators are used to compare selected historical energy use projections for the Norwegian building stock against energy use from statistics from 2000 to 2020. The comparison shows large differences between the different projections, where calibrated scenarios show energy savings that tend to be more optimistic in the reference projection but more conservative in the best case potential.},

Dependency on net energy import ratio will grow by 5.838 times, vulnerability index and net oil import ratio will decrease by −1.276 and −1.105 under base scenarios. Due to maximum fuel consumption by the transport and other sectors, the CO2 emissions would increase by 407.49 Mt in 2040 which could be reduced by renewable energy resources. Finally, energy security and energy supply are optimal in the reduction scenarios which will lessen cost, CO2, and energy supply. Related policies are given below.},

The most important policy instrument for reaching this national target is the introduction of the common market for green certificates between Norway and Sweden. This new market mechanism is promoting new, renewable power projects until 2020, and is expected to generate 26.4 TWh from 2020. The market mechanism is neutral regarding renewable technologies, and the two countries share the same level of ambition regarding production increases of the common market. In the green certificate market the power producers receive electricity certificates from the authorities, and these can be sold to electricity suppliers and certain electricity users. The electricity customers cover the costs of the system, as the costs of purchasing certificates are added to the electricity bill. The price of electricity certificates is determined by supply and demand. A new energy system model covering Norway and Sweden is developed to analyze the impact of the green certificate market. The model covers five Norwegian and four Swedish regions, with exchange of electricity between adjacent regions and neighboring countries. Various scenarios are analyzed, focusing especially on various risk factors (e.g. grid expansion, delays of new power plants, transmission grid limitations, coordination issues between grid and power projects, licensing issues, etc), as well as the impact of variations in energy demand, energy prices and certificate prices. The analyses indicate the choice of power plant technology being installed depending on the scenario assumptions, as well as the timing and the geographical location of the various plants.},

This new model is developed with a high time resolution among others to be able to analyse intermittent power production. Model results indicate that the RES target can be achieved with a diversity of options including investments in hydropower, wind power, high-voltage power lines for export, various heat pump technologies, energy efficiency measures and increased use of biodiesel in the transportation sector.

The carbon emission reduction effects will gradually increase with carbon price. When the carbon price attains to CN¥150 t−1CO2, the CO2 emission can decrease by 36% than that without carbon price. (3) CCUS is one of important contributing factor to reduce CO2 emission in power sector. Generally speaking, the development of non-fossil fuels and energy efficiency improvement are two main drivers for carbon mitigation, but once the carbon price reaches up to CN¥106 t−1CO2, the CCUS will be required to equip with thermal power units and its contribution on carbon emission reduction will remarkably increase. When carbon price increases to CN¥150 t−1CO2 in 2050, the application of CCUS will account for 44% of total emission reduction. (4) In the scenario with carbon price of CN¥150 t−1CO2, power sector would be decarbonized significantly, and the CO2 intensity will be 0.22 kgCO2 (kW h)−1, but power sector is far from the goal that achieving net zero emission. In order to realize the long-term low greenhouse gas emission development goal that proposed by the Paris Agreement, more efforts are needed to be put to further reduce the carbon emission reduction of power sector. Based on the above scenario analysis, the study proposes four recommendations on the low-carbon development of China's power sector: (1) improve the energy efficiency proactively and optimize the energy structure of power sector gradually; (2) promote the low-carbon transition of power sector by using market-based mechanism like carbon emission trading scheme to internalize the external cost of carbon emission; (3) give more emphasis on and support to the CCUS application in power sector.},

abstract = {The Chinese power sector faces a significant challenge in attempting to mitigate its CO2 emissions while meeting its fast-growing demand for electricity. To address this challenge, an analytical framework is proposed that incorporates technological learning curves in a technology optimization model. The framework is employed to evaluate the technology trajectories, resource utilization and economic impacts in the power sector of Tianjin in 2005–2050. Using multi-scenario analysis, this study reveals that CO2 emissions could be significantly reduced if relevant mitigation policies are introduced. The main technologies adopted are ultra-super-critical combustion, integrated gasification combined cycle, wind power, hydropower, biomass power, solar photovoltaic power and solar thermal power. Despite uncertainties, nuclear power and CO2 capture and storage technology could be cost competitive in the future. The CO2 emissions cap policy has the advantage of realizing an explicit goal in the target year, while the renewable energy policy contributes to more cumulative CO2 emissions reduction and coal savings. A carbon tax of 320 CNY/ton CO2 would contribute to early renewable energy development and more CO2 reduction in the short run. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the impacts on the power system of learning rates, technology cost reductions and energy fuel price trajectories.},

This implies the implementation of innovative decisional tools for policy assessment to support the policy makers in the definition of effective energy-environmental strategies, coherent at different spatial scales. In this framework partial equilibrium models as the TIMES models generator, developed under the IEA-ETSAP Programme, represent a powerful tool to analyse global, national and local issues and to support the formulation of comprehensive policies. These tools are utilized in the framework of the Integrated Project NEEDS of the VI Framework Programme to implement a unique modelling platform, the Pan European NEEDS TIMES model, based on the integration of the energy system models of 30 EU countries, which are linked by energy and emissions trades. This paper is aimed to describe the NEEDS TIMES methodological approach in the Slovenia case study, providing a full picture of the actual national energy system and discussing the model indications for its development on a 50-year time horizon, based on a least-cost approach in an unconstrained (Business As Usual - BAU) scenario.},

Policy targets to achieve decarbonisation goals for national energy systems will therefore impact levels of air pollution. Advantages can be gained from considering these co-impacts when analysing technology transition scenarios in order to avoid tension between climate change and air quality policies. We incorporated non-GHG air pollution into a bottom-up, technoeconomic energy systems model that is at the core of UK decarbonisation policy development. We then used this model to assess the co-impacts of decarbonisation on other types of air pollution and evaluated the extent to which transition pathways would be altered if these other pollutants were considered. In a scenario where the UK meets its existing decarbonisation targets to 2050, including the costs of non-GHG air pollution led to a 40% and 45% decrease in PM10 and PM2.5 pollution (respectively) between 2010 and 2050 due to changes in technology choice in residential heating. Conversely, limited change in the pollution profile for transportation were observed, suggesting that other policy strategies will be necessary to reduce pollution from transport.},

abstract = {This article analyzes the feasibility of attaining a variety of climate targets during the 21st century, under alternative cooperation regimes by groups of countries. Five climate targets of increasing severity are analyzed, following the EMF-22 experiment. Each target is attempted under two cooperation regimes, a First Best scenario where all countries fully cooperate from 2012 on, and a Second Best scenario where the World is partitioned into three groups, and each group of countries enters the cooperation at a different date, and implement emission abatement actions in a progressive manner, once in the coalition. The resulting ten combinations are simulated via the ETSAP-TIAM technology based, integrated assessment model. In addition to the 10 separate case analyses, the article proposes a probabilistic treatment of three targets under the First Best scenario, and shows that the three forcing targets may in fact be interpreted as a single target on global temperature change, while assuming that the climate sensitivity Cs is uncertain. It is shown that such an interpretation is possible only if the probability distribution of Cs is carefully chosen. The analysis of the results shows that the lowest forcing level is unattainable unless immediate coordinated action is undertaken by all countries, and even so only at a high global cost. The middle and the high forcing levels are feasible at affordable global costs, even under the Second Best scenario. Another original contribution of this article is to explain why certain combinations of technological choices are made by the model, and in particular why the climate target clearly supersedes the usually accepted objective of improving energy efficiency. The analysis shows that under some climate targets, it is not optimal to improve energy efficiency, but rather to take advantage of certain technologies that help to reach the climate objective, but that happen to be less energy efficient than even the technologies in the reference scenario. This is particularly observable in the power generation sector and in some end-use sectors. Finally, the article discusses the pros and cons of the stochastic programming treatment of forcing targets, and compares it with the separate simulations of the various deterministic cases. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {National carbon mitigation policy included in the Clean Power Plan (CPP) targets electric power generation facilities and may have substantial impacts at the national level. The subnational impacts will vary because the level of dependence on coal for electricity generation varies substantially across states. Indiana represents a state where the CPP impacts may be relatively large due to heavy dependence on coal for electricity generation. Therefore, this paper presents analysis of the efficacy and cost of alternative approaches to carbon mitigation policy, taking Indiana as an example. A state-level energy system model, IN-MARKAL, was developed based on the MARKAL framework to explore alternative policy scenarios. Results show that a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is relatively cost effective in achieving carbon emissions reduction for Indiana from the perspective of the power system alone, but that the RPS may also lead to a generation mix dominated by coal and wind. Carbon cap and carbon tax outperform the RPS when considering the entire energy system modeled in IN-MARKAL, which also lead to a more diverse generation portfolio for the state.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the impact of postponing global mitigation action on abatement costs and energy systems changes in China and India. It compares energy-system changes and mitigation costs from a global and two national energy-system models under two global emission pathways with medium likelihood of meeting the 2 °C target: a least-cost pathway and a pathway that postpones ambitious mitigation action, starting from the Copenhagen Accord pledges. Both pathways have similar 2010-2050 cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis shows that postponing mitigation action increases the lock-in in less energy efficient technologies and results in much higher cumulative mitigation costs. The models agree that carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear energy are important mitigation technologies, while the shares of biofuels and other renewables vary largely over the models. Differences between India and China with respect to the timing of emission reductions and the choice of mitigation measures relate to differences in projections of rapid economic change, capital stock turnover and technological development. Furthermore, depending on the way it is implemented, climate policy could increase indoor air pollution, but it is likely to provide synergies for energy security. These relations should be taken into account when designing national climate policies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the effects of market-based mechanisms and carbon emission restrictions on the Brazilian energy system by comparing the results of six different energy-economic or integrated assessment models under different scenarios for carbon taxes and abatement targets up to 2050. Results show an increase over time in emissions in the baseline scenarios due, largely, to higher penetration of natural gas and coal. Climate policy scenarios, however, indicate that such a pathway can be avoided. While taxes up to 32 US$/tCO2e do not significantly reduce emissions, higher taxes (from 50 US$/tCO2e in 2020 to 16 2US$/tCO2e in 2050) induce average emission reductions around 60% when compared to the baseline. Emission constraint scenarios yield even lower reductions in most models. Emission reductions are mostly due to lower energy consumption, increased penetration of renewable energy (especially biomass and wind) and of carbon capture and storage technologies for fossil and/or biomass fuels. This paper also provides a discussion of specific issues related to mitigation alternatives in Brazil. The range of mitigation options resulting from the model runs generally falls within the limits found for specific energy sources in the country, although infrastructure investments and technology improvements are needed for the projected mitigation scenarios to achieve actual feasibility.},

As a response, the Chinese government has proposed a series of carbon mitigation strategies, such as switching the production structure and implementing energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies in energy-intensive sectors. In this paper, an integrated assessment approach was developed by combining the Stock-based model, the China-TIMES model and the co-benefits analysis model. The approach was applied to China's steel sector to simulate the trends of energy consumption and air emissions (CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM10) during 2010-2050, under a reference scenario and three alternative carbon mitigation scenarios. The model quantified the air emission reductions, water conservation, and associated co-benefits during the study period. The modeling results show that by switching the production structure and implementing energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies, China's steel sector can achieve significant co-benefits of carbon mitigation, water conservation, averted mortality and averted morbidity. Despite certain limitations and uncertainties associated with the elements of the integrated assessment approach, the results demonstrate that substantial social benefits and health effects could be realized through carbon mitigation strategies in China's steel sector.},

Iron and steel industry accounts for the largest industrial source of Greenhouse gases (GHGs) and emits a lot of local air pollutants (NOx, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2). Multiple energy conservation technologies have been promoted by Chinese government to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions. Based on the national China-TIMES model, the Base scenario and two carbon constraint scenarios are formulated, to assess the emission reduction potentials and the cobenefit effects for these promoted technologies in the iron and steel industry. The results are as follows: the emissions of CO2 and SO2 will reach the peak in 2015; and the emissions will be 1264 Mt and 2.79 Mt, and then keep decreasing to 244 Mt and 0.43 Mt in 2050, other local air pollutants will keep declining during 2010∼2050. The CO2 reduction potential is about 45.7 Mt∼91.6 Mt, in which the coke-making, iron-making and casting processes have the largest contribution to this. The emissions of local air pollutants will be reduced significantly under the two CO2 emission reduction scenarios. The reduction of CO2 has the most significant co-benefit effect on reducing SO2 emissions, but limited co-benefit effect on reducing PM2.5.},

abstract = {Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) has been widely utilized on national, regional or building levels, as its ability of reducing carbon emissions and easing energy consumption intensity. Techno-economic analysis of HRES is essential to embody its superiority and identify what kind of system and corresponding considerations are needed for a certain situation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of techno-economic analysis methods for the systems at national, regional and building scales. All methods are discussed in a comparative way including 31 computer tools and 20 arithmetical models. Main features, applications and merits of these methods are introduced and compared in detail regarding the analyzed space. Problems such as improper use of analysis methods or ignoring specific considerations may occur in the process of HRES designing and evaluating. As a result, a framework is proposed for techno-economic analysis of HRES at different spatial scales, including promising analysis process, research constraints and recommended tools for fulfilling different objectives. This framework provides critical references for researchers, decision makers and system designers, further supporting the application of future HRES.},

The technico-economic analysis supported by the TIMES-FR model brings robust lessons, whichever technological options are selected:. •The cliff effect puts the French system "up against the wall": sustained investments must be made to renew electricity production facilities coming to the end of their lives. •This situation opens up opportunities to all industrial channels, with the main challenge being to sustain an ambitious pace of constructing new capacities and answering specific questions for each of them, such as acceptability and reliability. •In parallel, the current paradigm of increasing electricity consumption is likely to be challenged over the coming decades if environmental issues are still part of public policy. •These factors make it possible to consider that the question of political options in terms of long-term energy cannot be restricted to a technological choice and must go beyond pro- or anti-nuclear lobbying.This contribution, which is mainly based on a technical thought process, should fit into the wider framework of a debate on society and behavior choices. The issue of the electricity user will be unavoidable.},

This issue is addressed for the Reunion Island, which aims to reach energy independence by 2030 using 100% renewables. To that end, a long-term power system analysis is proposed using a comprehensive and coherent approach based on a bottom-up TIMES model providing future production mixes according to different scenarios. A transient reliability indicator based on kinetic energy is proposed and endogenized within the model. In addition, a dedicated Kuramoto model describes the synchronism condition required for aggregating the kinetic energy embedded in the whole power system. For the case of Reunion island, this methodology draws the following conclusions: (i) to achieve the 100% renewables target, the capacity to invest in the energy sector is doubled, and the level of reliability decreases considerably; (ii) the loss of reliability induced by higher intermittency— typically 50% —in the power mix can be counter balanced and leveraged by implementing flexibility solutions (demand response and storage).},

abstract = {Long-term planning models are useful to describe future energy and technology options and to analyze environmental issues. They propose solutions for meeting future energy consumption. Focusing on the electricity sector, we argue that in order to provide a more relevant assessment of the power supply system ahead we need to tackle both flexibility needs and network reliability. On the one hand, flexibility is integrated in long-term planning models as an additional criterion for new investment decisions: it allows electricity generation capacity with short start-up periods to be part of the mix to satisfy peak demand, despite their higher marginal costs in comparison with the cost of base load technologies. On the other hand, and in order to assess network reliability, a suitable representation of dynamic dissipative processes over the electrical network is necessary. We introduce the notions of conveyance and reliability losses and their qualitative impacts on power transmission. We propose a methodology to exhibit the level of losses associated with a given level of reliability, whether generation capacities are centralized or decentralized. Our methodology is based on a thermodynamic description of the electric system and lumps it into a "one-loop grid". It provides a figure for the amount of reactive power and kinetic reserve needed to ensure network reliability and face admissible load fluctuations. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

At present Indian energy sector is dominated by fossil fuel. Due to international pressure for green house gas reduction in atmosphere there is a need of clean energy supply for energy security and sustainable development. The nuclear energy is a sustainable solution in this context to overcome the environmental problem due to fossil fuel electricity generation. This paper examines the implications of penetration of nuclear energy in Indian power sector. Four scenarios, including base case scenario, have been developed using MARKAL energy modeling software for Indian power sector. The least-cost solution of energy mix has been measured. The result shows that more than 50% of the electricity market will be captured by nuclear energy in the year 2045. This ambitious goal can be expected to be achieved due to Indo-US nuclear deal. The advanced nuclear energy with conservation potential scenario shows that huge amounts of CO2 can be reduced in the year 2045 with respect to the business as usual scenario. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

After the year 2040, the requirement for coal and gas goes down and carbon emissions decrease steeply.

Due to a number of events related to energy prices, security of supply and climate change, it has been necessary to develop cornerstones for a new integrated energy and climate policy. To supplement this decision process, model-based scenarios were used. In this paper we introduce fuzzy constraints to obtain a better representation of political decision processes, in particular, to find compromises between often contradictory targets (e.g. economic, environmentally friendly and secure energy supply). A number of policy aims derived from a review of the ongoing political discussions were formulated as fuzzy constraints to explicitly include trade-offs between various targets. The result is an overall satisfaction level of about 60% contingent upon the following restrictions: share of energy imports, share of biofuels, share of CHP electricity, CO2 reduction target and use of domestic hard coal. The restrictions for the share of renewable electricity, share of renewable heat, energy efficiency and postponement of nuclear phase out have higher membership function values, i.e. they are not binding and therefore get done on the side. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The possibility to realize an ambitious global emission reduction scenario is enhanced by coordinated action between countries in national policy implementation. An indicator for coordinated action is suggested. Targeted measures to increase deployment of nascent energy technologies and increasing energy efficiency in a small open economy like Norway are examined. The measures are evaluated against a set of baselines with different levels of spillover of technology learning from the global market. It is found that implementation of technology subsidies increase the national contribution to early deployment independent of the level of spillover. In a special case with no spillover for offshore floating wind power and endogenous technology learning substantial subsidy or a learning rate of 20% is required. Combining the high learning rate and a national subsidy increases the contribution to early deployment. Enhanced building code on the other hand may reduce Norway's contribution to early deployment, and thus the realization of a global emission reduction scenario, unless sufficient electricity export capacity is assured. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The technology composition, CO2 emissions and system cost in Norway up to 2050 exhibit sensitivity to spillover. Moreover, spillover may reduce both CO2 emissions and total system cost. National energy system analysis of low carbon society should therefore consider technology development paths in global policy scenarios.

abstract = {Decarbonising and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings is a priority for climate and energy policy. However, integrated energy systems modelling, commonly used to inform decarbonisation pathways, typically does not capture the heterogeneity of the dwelling stock, particularly internal dwelling temperatures, a key determinant of the cost of switching to low-carbon heating and upgrading building fabric. Addressing this gap, this paper presents a new model of the residential sector within an energy systems optimisation model (ESOM), which is developed using an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) database and measured energy consumption data, allowing for the heterogeneous depiction of the housing stock. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which has committed to ambitious legally binding climate targets. The Irish residential sector, which represented 22% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020, is characterised by poor thermal efficiency and high reliance on fossil fuels. The TIMES Ireland Model (TIM) is developed within a framework demonstrating cost-optimal pathways for energy supply, transformation, and demand sectors. The model is open-source, and the methodology outlined in this study is replicable for any country with an EPC database. The results presented are indicative of the type of insights that such modelling can provide and demonstrate that to meet climate targets, a rapid reduction in residential fossil fuel heating is necessary. The results show that deeper decarbonisation pathways require more thermal retrofits and electrical heat pumps, increasing the total cost of the energy system. The results explore the effect of internal temperatures, highlighting the importance of using empirical data for accounting for the rebound effect. Exemplifying the value of an integrated system modelling approach, deeper decarbonisation pathways place further costs on the electrical system.},

abstract = {The levels of investment needed to mobilize an energy system transformation and mitigate climate change are not known with certainty. This paper aims to inform the ongoing dialogue and in so doing to guide public policy and strategic corporate decision making. Within the framework of the LIMITS integrated assessment model comparison exercise, we analyze a multi-IAM ensemble of long-term energy and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Our study provides insight into several critical but uncertain areas related to the future investment environment, for example in terms of where capital expenditures may need to flow regionally, into which sectors they might be concentrated, and what policies could be helpful in spurring these financial resources. We find that stringent climate policies consistent with a 2°C climate change target would require a considerable upscaling of investments into low-carbon energy and energy efficiency, reaching approximately $45 trillion (range: $30-$75 trillion) cumulative between 2010 and 2050, or about $1.1 trillion annually. This represents an increase of some $30 trillion ($10-$55 trillion), or $0.8 trillion per year, beyond what investments might otherwise be in a reference scenario that assumes the continuation of present and planned emissions-reducing policies throughout the world. In other words, a substantial "clean-energy investment gap" of some $800 billion/yr exists - notably on the same order of magnitude as present-day subsidies for fossil energy and electricity worldwide ($523 billion). Unless the gap is filled rather quickly, the 2°C target could potentially become out of reach.},

abstract = {California has taken a leading role in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, requiring that its economy-wide emissions be brought back down to the 1990 level by 2020. The state also has a long-term, aspirational goal of an 80 percent reduction below the 1990 level by 2050. While the steps needed to achieve the near-term target have already been clearly defined by California policy makers, the suite of transformational technologies and policies required to decarbonize the energy system over the long term have not yet been explored. This paper describes an effort to fill this important gap, introducing CA-TIMES, a bottom-up, technologically-rich, integrated energy-engineering-environmental-economic systems model that has been developed to guide the long-term policy planning process. CA-TIMES is useful for exploring low-carbon scenarios, and the analyses described here focus on the potential evolution of the transportation, fuel supply, and electric generation sectors over the next several decades in response to various energy and climate policies. We find that meeting California's 80% emission reduction goal can be achieved through a combination of mitigation strategies, including managing the growth in energy service demand, increasing investments in efficiency and low-carbon energy supply technologies, and promoting demand technologies that facilitate end-use device electrification and a decrease in the direct use of hydrocarbon fuels through efficiency improvement and fuel switching. In such deep emission reduction scenarios, we estimate that energy system costs (accounting for investments on the energy supply side and in transportation demand technologies, as well as fuel and O&M costs) could be around 8-17% higher than in a reference case. Meanwhile, average abatement costs could range from $107 to $225/tCO 2. These estimates are very much dependent on a range of socio-political and technological uncertainties, for instance, the availability and cost of biomass, nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, and electric and hydrogen vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Uncertainties around technical learning rates; consumer behaviour; and the strategic interactions of governments, automakers and fuel providers are particularly acute. System dynamics and agent-based models, and studies of historical alternative fuel transitions, have furthered our understanding of possible transition dynamics, but these types of analysis exclude broader systemic issues concerning energy system evolution (e.g. supplies and prices of low-carbon energy) and the politics of transitions. This paper presents a hybrid approach to assessing hydrogen transitions in the UK, by linking qualitative scenarios with quantitative energy systems modelling using the UK MARKAL model. Three possible transition pathways are explored, each exploring different uncertainties and possible decision points, with modelling used to inform and test key elements of each scenario. The scenarios draw on literature review and participatory input, and the scenario structure is based on archetypal transition dynamics drawn from historical energy system transitions, reflecting insights relating to innovation system development and resistance to change.

abstract = {Bioenergy is an important renewable energy resource. However, assessments of the future of bioenergy are beset with uncertainty and contested values, suggesting that a precautionary approach to bioenergy resource development may be warranted. This paper uses UK MARKAL to examine the implications of adopting a precautionary approach to bioenergy development in the UK. The paper reports a detailed review of UK bioenergy resources and sustainability constraints, and develops precautionary and optimistic resource scenarios. The paper then examines the implications of these scenarios using the energy systems model MARKAL, finding that a precautionary approach adds to the cost of decarbonisation, but does not significantly alter the optimal technology mix. In particular, biomass and co-firing CCS emerge as optimal technologies across scenarios. The question of UK land availability for bioenergy production is highlighted within the paper. With less land available for bioenergy production, the costs of decarbonisation will rise; whereas if more land is available for bioenergy, then less land is available for either food production or ecosystem conservation. This paper quantifies one side of this trade-off, by estimating the additional costs incurred when UK land availability for bioenergy production is constrained. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Energy system optimization models (ESOMs) such as MARKAL/TIMES are used to support energy policy analysis worldwide. ESOMs cover the full life-cycle of fuels from extraction to end-use, including the associated direct emissions. Nevertheless, the life-cycle emissions of energy equipment and infrastructure are not modelled explicitly. This prevents analysis of questions relating to the relative importance of emissions associated with the build-up of infrastructure and other equipment required for decarbonization. We have soft-linked an environmentally-extended input-output (EEIO) model to a European TIMES Model (ETM-UCL) with the aim of addressing the following questions: - In what ways does the inclusion of indirect emissions change the optimal technology pathway for decarbonizing the European energy system?- How much does the present value of key low-carbon technologies change when indirect emissions are accounted for in a decarbonization scenario for Europe?We show that, although indirect emissions are a relatively small portion of overall power sector emissions (<10% in 2050), including them in the model leads to changes in the optimal power sector portfolio. Renewable energy technologies become relatively less attractive once indirect emissions are included within the optimization framework, and we quantify this effect, showing that it is not large. Changes to the relative attractiveness of specific renewable energy technologies are more pronounced than the reduction in attractiveness of renewable energy as a whole: in our main scenarios wind energy saw increased relative deployment in 2050 when indirect emissions are accounted for, since it displaced other technologies with higher life-cycle emissions (notably solar PV). Optimal cumulative installed capacity of PV in the EU 2050 is at least 7% lower when indirect emissions are included. We conclude that policy advice derived from ESOMs that focuses on the roles of specific technologies should ensure that it is robust to the possible effects of indirect emissions.},

abstract = {Oil and gas will play a central role in the global energy system for the foreseeable future. However, uncertainty surrounds both the availability of and demand for these fuels, and as a result, there are quite disparate viewpoints on the magnitude of this role. The aim of this thesis is to identify, understand, quantify and, where possible, minimise the sources of this uncertainty, and to investigate the implications that such uncertainties have on the future of oil and gas. There are two areas of original contribution to knowledge. First, while numerous studies have examined the availability of various subsets of oil and gas, often in a deterministic manner, this work provides a full description of the uncertainty in the resource potential of all individual categories of oil and gas. This includes estimating the uncertainty in resource availability at different costs of production, and also examining the resource potential of categories that have been previously overlooked. Second, the implications of this and other major sources of uncertainty have never been investigated using models that incorporate both supply and demand-side dynamics. Two models are used for this purpose. The first is an existing energy systems model, TIAM-UCL, which has been substantially modified to allow a more accurate characterisation of long-term oil and gas production and consumption. The second is an oil-sector specific model that has been developed named the 'Bottom-Up Geological and Economic Oil field production model' (BUEGO). This is capable of examining oil production potential to 2035 and is used to examine shorter-term and more sector specific uncertainties.},

abstract = {This paper examines the volumes of oil that can and cannot be used up to 2035 during the transition to a low-carbon global energy system using the global energy systems model, TIAM-UCL and the 'Bottom up Economic and Geological Oil field production model' (BUEGO). Globally in a scenario allowing the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) nearly 500 billion barrels of existing 2P oil reserves must remain unused by 2035. In a scenario where CCS is unavailable this increases to around 600 billion barrels. Besides reserves, arctic oil and light tight oil play only minor roles in a scenario with CCS and essentially no role when CCS is not available. On a global scale, 40% of those resources yet to be found in deepwater regions must remain undeveloped, rising to 55% if CCS cannot be deployed. The widespread development of unconventional oil resources is also shown to be incompatible with a decarbonised energy system even with a total and rapid decarbonisation of energetic inputs. The work thus demonstrates the extent to which current energy policies encouraging the unabated exploration for, and exploitation of, all oil resources are incommensurate with the achievement of a low-carbon energy system. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The UK has ambitious, statutory long-term climate targets that will require deep decarbonisation of its energy system. One key question facing policymakers is the role of natural gas both during the transition towards, and in the achievement of, a future low-carbon energy system. Here we assess a range of possible futures for the UK, and find that gas is unlikely to act as a cost-effective ‘bridge' to a decarbonised UK energy system. There is also limited scope for gas in power generation after 2030 if the UK is to meet its emission reduction targets, in the absence of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Without CCS, a 'second dash for gas' while providing short-term gains in reducing emissions, is unlikely to be the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, and could result in stranded assets and compromise the UK's decarbonisation ambitions. In such a case, gas use in 2050 is estimated at only 10% of its 2010 level. However, with significant CCS deployment by 2050, natural gas could remain at 50–60% of the 2010 level, primarily in the industrial (including hydrogen production) and power generation sectors.},

It is unclear as to what level of distributed generation is expected, appropriate or optimal in future power systems. Many researchers have focused on how to integrate distributed generation into centralised electricity systems. Such research tends to consider optimality from narrow viewpoints focused on particular aspects of the electricity network such as the distribution network within the confines of a vision of future electricity systems where centralised infrastructure remains. There is a gap in the literature in considering the role of distributed generation (DG) within the context of the entire electricity system and the wider energy sector and how it can drive the development of an electricity system to maintain a centralised approach or increase decentralisation. This paper explores the factors that influence the role of DG in future electricity systems and the existing tools that can be used to explore how these factors can impact the role of DG considering four future visions for electricity systems each with increasing levels of decentralisation. The review concludes that there is no one tool that can be used to explore all of the factors and their impact on the role of DG.},

It describes how a bottom-up long-term energy model can be used in a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. The proposed methodology is applied in a case study about the global warming impacts occurring as a consequence of the future production of synthetic diesel from biomass ("biomass to liquids" - BTL), a second-generation biofuel, in France. The results show a high sensitivity of the system-wide GHG balance to (i) the policy context and to (ii) the economic environment. Both influence the substitutions occurring within the system due to the production of BTL. Under the specific conditions of this study, the consequences of introducing BTL are not clear-cut. Therefore, we focus on the lessons from the detailed analysis of the results more than in the precise-looking projections, illustrating how this type of models can be used for strategic planning (industry and policy makers). TIMES-type models allow a detailed description of the numerous technologies affected by BTL production and how these vary under different policy scenarios. Moreover, some recommendations are presented, which should contribute for a proper systematization of consequential and prospective LCA methodologies. We provide argumentation on how to define a functional unit and system boundaries that are better linked with the goal of the study. Other crucial methodological issues are also discussed: how to treat temporal aspects in such environmental evaluation and how to increase the consistency of prospective life cycle assessments.},

It is shown that standard TIMES does not allow for an appropriate implementation of residential heat systems. Consequently a two-part solution procedure is presented. A special integrated TIMES feature is explored and a tailor-made methodological extension of the TIMES standard code developed. Mixed integer programming is employed to accurately model the capacity planning of residential heat supply systems. Model results yielded by the new approach comply with the realistic capacity planning of heat supply systems in a shortened computation time. A case study for selected residential heat demand categories yields contrasting results for the mixed integer programme and the standard linear programme. The model's extension to cover larger, centralised combined heat and power plants and district heating networks remains for further work; the lower solution times encountered seem promising in this respect. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The residential building sector has an important role to play in the energy transition due to a high share of final energy consumed and a considerable amount of CO2 emitted. Ambitious targets in Germany relate amongst other things to a primary energy reduction of 80% and an increased usage of renewable energy sources in heat supply to 60% in 2050. Existing research in this area both lacks detail in modelling decentralised heat supply in residential buildings and fails to adequately quantitatively analyse this target achievement for Germany. In order to overcome these limitations, a novel model-based approach is presented in which the developed TIMES-HEAT-POWER optimisation model is coupled with a decentralised energy system optimisation model to determine optimal and realistic technology configurations, and a building stock simulation model to adequately and consistently project the evolution of the building stock in Germany. This novel configuration of models is then used to investigate the evolution of the electricity system and the residential heat system in Germany in the context of key energy-political targets up to 2050. The national goals related to primary energy reduction and the share of renewable energy sources in final energy demand in the residential heat sector are missed in the Reference Scenario. On the other hand, target achievement requires deep insulation measures and a supply-side technology shift away from gas and oil boilers towards heat pumps and solar thermal. The scenario analysis reveals a significant sensitivity of the deployment of micro-Combined heat and power technologies ($\mu$CHP) and heat pumps to, amongst other things, the evolution of fuel prices, renewable electricity technologies, heat and electricity demand as well as technological progress. Further model extension can be identified inter alia in broadening the system boundaries to integrate further sectors (tertiary, industrial) or incorporating different user categories and decision rationales.},

Pregabalin is a recently developed antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic neuropathic pain conditions. OBJECTIVES: To assess analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of pregabalin in acute and chronic pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL to May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers and on-line clinical trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double blind trials reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the patient as either the primary or a secondary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse events and study withdrawals. MAIN RESULTS: There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis.Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia.With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo.Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin has proven efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions and fibromyalgia. A minority of patients will have substantial benefit with pregabalin, and more will have moderate benefit. Many will have no or trivial benefit, or will discontinue because of adverse events. Individualisation of treatment is needed to maximise pain relief and minimise adverse events. There is no evidence to support the use of pregabalin in acute pain scenarios.},

This paper uses several well-known energy system and electricity models to analyze a CES that reflects broad principles outlined in President Obama's January 2011 State of the Union Address and in the Administration's subsequent Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future.1 In particular, it examines three different design options for a CES that would each lead to approximately 80% clean electricity by 2035. These different design options provide broadly similar economic incentives for clean energy deployment and yield similar overall welfare impacts, but they exhibit different distributional outcomes. The most inclusive CES crediting approach favors producers over consumers in competitive electricity markets as well as regions with larger initial endowments of clean energy. On the other hand, the most restrictive crediting approach favors consumers over producers and reduces preferences for regions with larger initial endowments of clean energy. While specific technology outcomes vary across the four models used in this study, key insights about cost-effectiveness and economic incidence are largely robust to theunderlying modeling platform. These insights may be important considerations in future CES policy design efforts.},

Using the insights from a long-term bottom-up energy systems model, and undertaking a sectoral assessment, we investigated the importance of CCS in the industrial sector. Under climate policy aimed at limiting atmospheric concentration of GHGs to 650 ppm CO2e, costs could increase fivefold when CCS is excluded from the portfolio of mitigation option measures in the industry sector as compared to when CCS is excluded in the power sector. This effect is driven largely by the lack of alternatives for deep emission reductions in industry. Our main policy conclusion is that a broader recognition of CCS in industrial applications in both current policy discussions and research, development, and demonstration funding programmes is justified. In recognition of the heterogeneity of the many types of industrial production processes, the size and location of industrial CO2 sources, the specific need for CCS-retrofitting, and the exposure of most industrial sectors to international trade, policies aimed at supporting CCS must distinguish between the different challenges faced by the power and industrial sectors.},

After the oil crisis, both countries chose to reduce their oil consumption by developing nuclear power. However, Sweden pursued a more diversified energy policy that has subsequently allowed it to reduce its CO2 emissions. Today, both countries have committed to a carbon neutrality goal: by 2045 for Sweden and 2050 for France. In order to understand the key factors that can drive energy transition toward a carbon neutrality goal, we propose to compare the past energy transitions in France and Sweden, two countries that have significantly reduced their CO2 emissions and fossil fuel dependency. To assess the impacts of the current energy system and its regulations on the feasibility of meeting carbon neutrality, we use TIMES bottom-up energy system optimization models. The results show that France faces more challenges in transforming its energy system than Sweden i.e. an increase in power production, a decrease in gas consumption, the replacement of heating systems in buildings, and the electrification of industry, thus confirming that its energy policy has to be driven with a long-run perspective.},

By analogy, we consider a pathway of the energy system as a phase in physics and the total discounted cost of the energy system as the Gibbs free energy. In physics, the transition between two phases is possible if their Gibbs free energies have the same value. Likewise, the transition between two pathways of the energy system is possible if their costs are similar.

This creates a challenge for properly modelling such intermittent variable resources since: (i) their availability varies spatially and temporally and (ii) thus, their integration in power systems is determined by the configuration of transmission grids. Large energy system models usually adopt simplified approaches for modelling wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment and the power grid. This paper uses the recently developed TIMES-Brazil optimisation model to study the role of transmission bottlenecks in cost-effective long-term deployment of wind and solar power in the Brazilian energy system up to 2050. The model explicitly models the grid infrastructure of 29 regions in Brazil differentiated according to existing power plants, wind and solar availabilities, future RES potentials and power demand. Three different scenarios (Free Trade, Simplified Trade and Detailed Trade), with increasingly more detail in modelling electricity transmission lines, were tested. Findings show that a more detailed transmission infrastructure significantly affects capacity deployments and electricity prices. The grid connecting the North and South of Brazil was found to be the most important bottleneck affecting the deployment of solar in the country.},

The country is believed to have abundant energy resources, however, coping substantial electricity supply gap of over 5000 MW. This paper analyses country's energy and power planning studies conducted since its independence in 1947 and policies announced so far. It is found that water resources management attained more emphasis in early decades of post-independence rather than energy concerns. The first energy and power planning study was conducted in late 1960s and since then various studies were undertaken to supplement five yearly medium term development plans of government. However, it is pertinent to mention that formal energy and power policies were only announced from 1994 onwards owing to growing electricity demand and progressing industrialization. Beside this, the focus of these policies is not only varied but were conceived without undertaking integrated energy planning using energy modeling tools e.g. MARKAL/TIMES; LEAP, ENPEP BALANCE, MESSAGE and EnergyPLAN. It is despite the fact that these tools are successfully applied globally for devising the energy policies and address the complexities of energy system by assisting effective policy formulation. This study recommends that integrated energy planning using energy modeling tools will be helpful to develop sustainable energy policies in Pakistan to eradicate electricity crises.},

abstract = {Research efforts to analyse China's future energy system increased tremendously over the past decade. One prominent research area is China's first binding CO2 emission intensity target per unit of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and its impact on the country's economy and energy system. This paper compares 18 energy modelling tools from ten Chinese institutions. These models have been described in English language publications between 2005 and 2013, although not all are published in peer-reviewed journals. When comparing the results for three main energy system indicators across models, this paper finds that there are considerable ranges in the reference scenarios: (i) GDP is projected to grow by 630-840% from 2010 to 2050, (ii) energy demand could increase by 200-300% from 2010 to 2050, and (iii) CO2 emissions could rise by 160-250% from 2010 to 2050. Although the access to the modelling tools and the underlying data remains challenging, this study concludes that the Chinese perspective, independently from the modelling approach and institution, suggests a rather gradual and long-term transition towards a low carbon economy in China. Few reference scenarios include an emission peak or stabilisation period before 2040. While policy scenarios frequently suggest efficiency improvements, a short-term and large-scale introduction of non-fossil power technologies is rarely recommended. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Various new technologies promise to change this, but their development is highly uncertain. This paper aims to analyze the prospects of key low-carbon technologies in the sector, focusing on the impact of technology learning, in the light of the uncertainty related to the learning rate. An optimization energy system model was used with an iterative learning formulation, adopting different learning assumptions. The results show that learning may have only a minor impact in the short and medium term, reducing global carbon emissions of the sector by 3% (at most) in 2050, compared to a non-learning scenario. In the long term, high learning potentials for novel processes are important, leading to a market share of up to the 80% by the end of the century. The learning potential for Carbon Capture and Storage processes, however, plays no role in the simulations. Early investments and research and development can help unlock the full potential of the technologies, while more detailed studies should be performed to better understand the retrofitting impact in the shorter term.},

In all scenarios, the results show a large potential for renewable energy technologies, such as hydropower, solar PV and wind. These technologies have implications for neighboring countries in the region and will also affect the agriculture sector in Ethiopia. Hydropower, for example, is a renewable energy source that can contribute to rural electrification, while also providing water to support irrigation expansion. An alternative policy scenario prioritizing renewable energy technologies reduces dependence on fossil fuel completely at minimal cost, while providing long-term environmental benefits. Expansion of electricity access to the entire population entails large investments in power generation capacity as well as substantial increases in the total system cost of energy production. Such a scenario would also increase the country's reliance on fossil fuels and geothermal energy sources. Most alternative policy options show higher investment costs will be required to achieve policy goals in the near term (with the exception of the export scenario). However, the analysis shows long-term benefits from investing in energy supply including sustainable energy system development, expansion of access to modern sources of energy, and the development of a low carbon society.},

Four alternative scenarios are developed for the 2014–2050 period to assess national and regional benefits of alternative energy development strategies. The study finds that electricity trading scenarios out-perform a reference scenario that assumes no energy trading, lowering systems cost by 4.5–7.2%. Total systems costs are lower, even when transmission costs for trade are considered. Costs are also lower with increased generation from renewables compared to investments without regional trade. Investing in renewables has important co-benefits, such as improved energy security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Supporting energy trade not only reduces systems costs, but can also strengthen cooperation in the region, as reflected in the energy trading efforts of the East African Power Pool and the transboundary collaboration efforts of the Nile Basin Initiative.},

abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of alternative, long-term energy supply and low-carbon strategies for the Philippine power sector from 2014 to 2040 using TIMES model. It examines the potential contribution of renewable energy to diversify the Philippine energy supply-mix to meet future electricity demands. The reference scenario compares the impact of four alternative policy goals: (1) carbon tax, (2) targeted renewable-based power generation, (3) limited coal share in supply-mix, and (4) renewables subsidy. The reference scenario shows a significant increase of the share of coal-based power generation and import dependency of fossil-fuel increases from 227 PJ in 2016 to 1073 PJ in 2040. The model results for the alternative policy scenarios show a large potential for renewable energy-based power generation. The alternative policy options show a significant decrease of import dependency in the energy supply-mix for power generation. Most alternative policy scenarios project a higher total system cost, with the exception of the subsidy scenario. System cost increases only 2.6% in the renewables target scenario relative to the reference scenario. However, long-term benefits from investing in the alternative policy options would need to be considered, including diversification of energy supply-mix, improved energy security, and progress toward a low-carbon society.},

abstract = {Floating offshore wind energy is an emerging technology that provides access to new wind generation sites allowing for a diversified wind supply in future low carbon electricity systems. We use a high spatial and temporal resolution power system optimisation model to explore the conditions that lead to the deployment of floating offshore wind and the effect this has on the rest of the electricity system for Great Britain in 2050. We perform a sensitivity analysis on three dimensions: total share of renewables, floating offshore costs and the impact of waves on operation. We find that all three impact the deployment of floating offshore wind energy. A clear competition between floating offshore wind and conventional offshore wind is demonstrated, with less impact on other renewable sources. It is shown that floating wind is used to provide access to greater spatial diversification. Further, access to more distant regions also affects the optimal placement of conventional offshore wind, as spatial diversification is spread between floating and bottom-mounted sites.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the potential impact of the transportation sector on the role of fusion power in the energy system of the 21st century. Key indicators in this context are global passenger and freight transportation activities, consumption levels of fuels used for transportation purposes, the electricity generation mix and greenhouse gas emissions. These quantities are calculated by means of the global multi-regional EFDA-TIMES energy system model. For the present study a new transportation module has been linked to the EFDA-TIMES framework in order to arrive at a consistent projection of future transportation demands. Results are discussed implying various global energy scenarios including assumed crossovers of road transportation activities towards hydrogen or electricity infrastructures and atmospheric CO2 concentration stabilization levels at 550 ppm and 450 ppm. Our results show that the penetration of fusion power plants is only slightly sensitive to transportation fuel choices but depends strongly on assumed climate policies. In the most stringent case considered here the contribution of electricity produced by fusion power plants can become as large as about 50% at the end of the 21st century. This statement, however, is still of preliminary nature as the EFDA-TIMES project has not yet reached a final status. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Multi-modelling approaches facilitate improved understanding of the detailed technology pathways required to meet decarbonisation targets; however, to-date there has been limited attention on the policy roadmaps and enabling measures that might achieve these decarbonisation targets. This paper addresses this gap by developing a multi-model approach using an energy systems optimisation model, a sectoral simulation model together with scrutiny of individual policy measures to explore decarbonisation of the private car sector in the Irish transport system commensurate with an 80% reduction in national carbon emissions by 2050. The results comprise a cost optimal technology pathway for private cars in a future energy system constrained by a maximum level of carbon emissions, a policy roadmap identifying annual changes in energy efficiency, renewable energy and electrification, and a suite of enabling measures including changes to vehicle registration tax, a biofuel obligation on suppliers and a suite of measures to increase the share of electric vehicles in the fleet. The level of confidence in the different enabling measures to achieve the policy goals is compared and discussed.},

abstract = {Recent developments in European energy policy reveal an increasing interest in implementing the so-called 'Tradable White Certificate' (TWC) schemes to improve energy efficiency. Based on three evaluation criteria (cost-effectiveness, environmental effectiveness and distributional equity) this paper analyses the implications of implementing a European-wide TWC scheme targeting the household and commercial sectors. Using a bottom-up model, quantitative results show significant cost-effective potentials for improvements (ca. 1400 TWh in cumulative energy savings by 2020), with the household sector, gas and space heating representing most of the TWC supply in terms of eligible sector, fuel and energy service demand, respectively. If a single market price of negative externalities is considered, a societal cost-effective potential of energy savings above 30% (compared to the baseline) is observed. In environmental terms, the resulting greenhouse gas emission reductions are around 200 Mt CO2-eq by 2010, representing nearly 60% of the EU-Kyoto-target. From the qualitative perspective, several embedded ancillary benefits are identified (e.g. employment generation, improved comfort level, reduced 'fuel poverty', security of energy supply). Whereas an EU-wide TWC increases liquidity and reduces the risks of market power, autarky compliance strategies may be expected in order to capture co-benefits nationally. Cross subsidies could occur due to investment recovery mechanisms and there is a risk that effects may be regressive for low-income households. Assumptions undertaken by the modelling approach strongly indicate that high effectiveness of other policy instruments is needed for an EU-wide TWC scheme to be cost-effective. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Deep decarbonisation pathways can enable the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia to reach a net-zero emissions reduction goal and contribute to global mitigation efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5 °C by mid-century. This paper explores minimum cost solutions for achieving the corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target for NSW, using an Australian implementation of the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) energy system modelling framework. This paper investigated possible decarbonisation pathways and available technology options to reach the target. It includes both a higher emissions reference case scenario and a scenario implementing the NSW state government's target of net-zero emissions by 2050 under the NSW Climate Change Policy Framework, consistent with the international Paris Agreement on climate change, with available and viable well-developed technologies. The findings show that the NSW energy system can continue its shift from fossil fuels to renewables like solar, wind, and hydro and can entirely phase out coal- and gas-fired electricity generation by 2050. The deployment of zero-emissions technologies along with policy supports are crucial to achieving deep decarbonisation of the NSW economy by 2050. In addition, electrification and energy efficiency improvements play a significant role in the end-use sector's energy consumption reduction in the coming decades. This paper shows that the electricity sector is the dominant contributor to emission reductions up to the year 2030, while transport, buildings, and industry sectors are set to decarbonise later in the projection period (2030–2050) along this least-cost trajectory. However, the NSW government's aspirational target of net-zero emissions by 2050 can be achieved by 2039 by offsetting negative emissions.},

The model evaluates the implication of greenhouse gas emission's reduction on the techno-economic and environmental evolution of Kenya's power system under three government-projected electricity demand levels, which covers the 2020–2045 period. To assess the implications of greenhouse gas emission reduction measures, a business as usual and a carbon emission cap scenarios were developed. The model shows that energy security can be achieved under the two scenarios, and for all the three demand levels. The generation mix suggested by the model is dominated by renewable sources under the carbon emission cap scenario compared to the business as usual scenario. The higher share of renewable technologies under the carbon emission cap scenario results in lower emission but increased electricity cost. Consequently, to meet its emission reduction targets, the Kenyan government need to enact and implement policies that will enhance deployment of renewable energy technologies. The findings indicate that the Kenyan government should prioritize developing geothermal and hydropower resources in the short- to medium-term, which can provide affordable and secure energy while limiting GHG emissions.},

The benefit is monetized in order to incorporate it into a cost minimization objective function, and we focus on the impact of the differences in the value on the Japanese energy system and employment. Our results suggest that when considering employment effects of rural power plants, renewable power generation will increase up to 350 TWh, mainly biomass and solar photovoltaic, in 2030. Total employment associated with power generation facilities in rural areas over the model period (45 y) will increase by up to 2.28 million person-year, and biomass power generation, in particular, can have a significant role in the revitalization of local economies owing to the large job creation effect during its operation and maintenance phase.},

abstract = {Limiting cumulative carbon emissions to keep global temperature increase to well below 2 °C (and as low as 1.5 °C) is an extremely challenging task, requiring rapid reduction in the carbon intensity of all sectors of the economy and with limited leeway for residual emissions. Addressing residual emissions in ‘challenging-to-decarbonise' sectors such as the industrial and aviation sectors relies on the development and commercialization of innovative advanced technologies, currently still in their infancy. The aim of this study was to (a) explore the role of advanced technologies in achieving deep decarbonisation of the energy system and (b) provide technology-specific details of how rapid and deep carbon intensity reductions can be achieved in the energy demand sectors. This was done using TIAM-Grantham – a linear cost optimization model of the global energy system with a detailed representation of demand-side technologies. We find that the inclusion of advanced technologies in the demand sectors, together with energy demand reduction through behavioural changes, enables the model to achieve the rapid and deep decarbonisation of the energy system associated with limiting global warming to below 2 °C whilst at the same time reduces reliance on negative emissions technologies by up to ∼18% compared to the same scenario with a standard set of technologies. Realising such advanced technologies at commercial scales, as well as achieving such significant reductions in energy demand, represents a major challenge for policy makers, businesses and civil society. There is an urgent need for continued R&D efforts in the demand sectors to ensure that advanced technologies become commercially available when we need them and to avoid the gamble of overreliance on negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions.},

abstract = {There is no doubt that the current century is an era of environmental awareness which will require meeting the growing demands by means of a set of generating technologies, while minimizing Greenhouse Gas emissions. Provided that technologies alone could not solve the problem, we have integrated the sociological dimension, represented by the potentially powerful resource for energy conservation that exists in the ability of consumers to change their behavior. The present study aims at assessing the joint impact of awareness campaigns and technology choice, on end-use energy consumption behavior. Actions to achieve energy savings through the use of more energy-efficient end-use technology are included. A new MARKAL framework - i.e., SOCIO-MARKAL - is proposed. As opposed to the traditional MARKAL framework based on technical and economic considerations, the SOCIO-MARKAL model integrates technological, economic and behavioral contributions to the environment. This study takes into consideration technological improvements on the demand side by consumers as well as behavioral changes minimizing carbon dioxide emissions and encouraging rational use of energy. Essentially, the conceptual aspects of the SOCIO-MARKAL will be presented. Based on this new MARKAL formulation, we will simulate the possible contribution of awareness campaigns in triggering energy consumption behavioral changes and possibilities of technology switch, in the residential area of the city of Nyon (Switzerland), for the period 2005-2025, using ANSWER, the IEA's platform.

Using the MARKAL model and covering a 20-year period to 2025, the study shows that there are substantial changes in the generation structure in favor of renewable energy technologies and other low emitting technologies. These changes lead to a reduction in fossil fuel requirements, and consequently, a reduction of CO2, NOx, SO2, and PM emissions which could be expected to also reduce the associated environmental and human health impacts. The avoided external costs would be equivalent to 4.4 US cent/kWh. However, these gains are not free as the additional electricity production cost would be around 2.6 US cent/kWh higher if the switch to more expensive, but lower emitting technologies were made. The net benefit of internalizing these externalities is thus around 1.8 US cent/kWh. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study explores how emissions from electricity generation in the Western Interconnection region of the U.S. might respond in circa 2030 to contrasting scenarios for fuel prices and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fees. We examine spatial and temporal variations in generation mix across the region and year using the PLEXOS unit commitment and dispatch model with a production cost model database adapted from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Emissions estimates are computed by combining the dispatch model results with unit-specific, emissions-load relationships. Wind energy displaces natural gas and coal in scenarios with relatively expensive natural gas or with GHG fees. Correspondingly, annual emissions of NOx, SO2, and CO2 are reduced by 20–40% in these cases. NOx emissions, which are a concern as a precursor of ground-level ozone, are relatively high and consistent across scenarios during summer, when peak electricity loads occur and wind resources in the region are comparatively weak. Accounting for the difference in start-up versus stabilized NOx emissions rates for natural gas plants had little impact on region-wide emissions estimates due to the dominant contribution from coal-fired plants, but would be more important in the vicinity of the natural gas units.},

This is accompanied by the demand for high result reproducibility in order to provide transparency to decision-makers in terms of assumptions and methodological issues. Given this background, Open Access Models (OAMs) are increasingly entering the market that already have a high degree of diversity. This study analyses and compares the methodological framework of different OAMs to assess long-term energy scenarios. In a first step, selected OAMs are typified and characterised based on predefined criteria. In general, the analysis reveals that OAMs with a high level of accessibility appear to have a rather low level of complexity and often focus on the analysis of a single target year. In a second step, we underline our findings of the model overview by applying a well-established OAM (DESSTinEE - Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE) to a current energy scenario for Germany. Overall, we conclude that current OAMs can already be applied to a large variety of research questions. However, comparing OAMs to conventional models applied in the field of energy system analysis reveals that there is still a significant performance gap in terms of the degree of methodological sophistication.},

abstract = {To reach the goals of long-term energy and climate policy, the contribution of the industrial sector is important. Upgrading low temperature industrial waste heat using electric high-temperature heat pumps (HTHPs) can improve the overall energy-efficiency and mitigate CO2 emissions by replacing fossil fuels. The pulp and paper and the food and beverage industries use significant quantities of heat up to 200 °C and therefore have a high potential for the application of HTHPs. In order to assess the role of HTHPs, a techno-economic bottom-up cost optimization model is developed building on the Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM). We present an advanced modeling framework including energy and material flows, with a high temporal resolution and a segregation of the temperature level of the process heat. The results show that HTHPs are cost-effective up to a temperature of 150 °C. Switzerland has the economic potential to deploy of about 100 MWth in the pulp and paper industry and 900 MWth in the food and beverage industry by 2050. Incentivizing the exploitation of this significant potential will require very high CO2 prices of several hundred €/tCO2 or additional policies to overcome investment barriers by supporting investment and flexible system-serving operation of heat pumps.},

abstract = {The present study investigates long-term energy consumption and CO2 emission pathways of the Swiss cement industry, including pathways towards net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Cement production accounts for 8% (12.8 PJ) of the final energy consumption and 36% (2.5 Mt) of the CO2 emissions in the Swiss industrial sector in 2015. Using a techno-economic bottom-up optimization model based on the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) modeling framework, this study applies an advanced modeling technique for the Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM) that expands the modeling of energy flows with additional material and product flow modeling. This allows a more detailed technology representation as well as to account for process related emissions in the cement sector. This modeling framework is applied for a scenario analysis focusing on energy efficiency as well as decarbonization, which ultimately contributes to an improved understanding of energy technology development and identifies policy strategies for the realization of a decarbonized cement industry. The results show that, in accordance with current trends, future cement production reduces its specific energy consumption from 3.0 GJ/tcement in 2015 to 2.3 GJ/tcement in 2050. Simultaneously, cement production decreases its CO2 emission intensity from 579 kgCO2/tcement in 2015 to 466 kgCO2/tcement in 2050 due to the decreasing average clinker content in cement and energy efficiency improvements. Even without major climate policy intervention in the future, it is economically beneficial to replace and improve the existing equipment with more energy efficient technologies. However, our results show that for a drastic reduction of the CO2 emissions in order to comply with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the cement sectors relies on CO2 capture because of the process related emissions. The results show that a minimum CO2 tax of 70 EUR/tCO2 is required for the CO2 capture technologies to become economically competitive.},

abstract = {The contribution of the industrial sector is essential to realize long-term energy and climate policy goals. The present research paper explores trajectories improving energy efficiency and reaching net-zero emissions in the Swiss pulp and paper industry by 2050. A techno-economic bottom-up cost optimization model is developed based on the Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM) and applied for a scenario analysis. Establishing an advanced modeling methodology including material and product flows in addition to energy flows, allowed us to assess explicit process improvements and the impact of specific innovative production technologies. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the value of dividing industrial heat demand into different temperature levels which enables a detailed assessment of high-temperature heat pumps and waste heat recovery as important decarbonization options in industry. The results of the scenario analysis performed with this advanced model show that an energy reduction of 23% and a reduction in the annual CO2 emissions of 71% until 2050 would result from a cost-optimal technology deployment even without major policy intervention, given the assumptions made on technology progress and costs. These improvements are achieved by fuel switching, improvements in the production processes and deployment of efficient technologies, in particular high-temperature heat pumps and efficient motors. Achieving a net-zero goal in the pulp and paper industry by 2050 requires increased amounts of biomass in the short term and additionally high-temperature heat pumps up to 200 °C in the long-term in case of biomass scarcity. On the other hand, this leads to 49% higher energy related costs compared to the baseline development, if all other sectors decarbonize simultaneously to reach net-zero CO2 emissions in Switzerland.},

Hydrogen is cost-effective in all scenarios with higher CO2 reduction targets. Hydrogen would be produced from fossil fuels, or from water and electricity or heat, depending upon the scenario. Hydrogen would be used in the residential and commercial sectors and for transport vehicles, industry, and electricity generation in fuel cells. At severe (50-70%) CO2 reduction targets, hydrogen would cost-effectively supply more than half of the total useful energy demands in three out of four scenarios. The marginal emission reduction costs in the CO2 removal scenario at severe CO2 reduction targets are DFL 200/tCO2 (ca $ 100/t). In the nuclear, renewable and energy conservation scenarios these costs are much higher. Whilst the fossil fuel scenario would be less expensive than the other scenarios, the possibility of CO2 storage in depleted gas reservoirs is a conditio sine qua non. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

This paper focuses on the effects of phasing-out fossil fuel consumption in on-field tractor operations with electrification by introducing battery-electric and/or fuel cell tractors and on-site renewable energy generation and storage. The results show that electrification of on-field tractor operations can be a techno-economically feasible pathway to reduce tractor energy-use-related CO2 emissions in the agricultural sector. Annual CO2 emissions are observed to reduce by 69% in 2030 and 97% in 2050. However, the CO2 reduction potential can vary significantly based on the farm type. In this regard, the analysis revealed high sensitivity to manufacturing costs of zero-emission tractors (ZETs), which in combination with a low utilization rate can render the investment to ZETs unprofitable. Moreover, electrification increases electricity consumption, especially peak electricity demand in the agricultural sector. This effect can be reduced with on-site renewable energy generation and energy storage systems.},

The concern is that relying on sometimes adversarial, sometimes unstable countries for a quarter of our oil carries certain risks. For that reason, reducing the external oil dependence has been of interest to policy makers. This paper examines the impacts and costs of transportation-based policies on light-duty vehicle fleet energy usage and emissions. Using the 2010 elastic version of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Market Allocation (MARKAL) model, recent increases in US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards are compared to what some economists suggest would be a much more "efficient" alternative-asystem-wide oil tax internalizing a number of environmental externalities. We discover that our series of oil taxes produce larger and more cost-effective reductions in economy-wide emissions than CAFE. The same cannot be said in regards to net oil imports. Stricter fuel economy regulations result in much larger cutbacks in imports than the oil tax. In fact, we found that in 2040 import demands are roughly 250 million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) higher with our oil tax regime than they are with CAFE. The additional import reductions achieved with stricter CAFE Standards do come, however, at a much larger cost to society. A great deal of these additional economic costs stems from greater usage of more energy-efficient automobiles and the higher initial capital costs associated with their adoption. In our supplementary analysis, we find that even if the costs of these types of vehicles are lowered by as much as 75%, oil taxes would still be able to maintain their competitive edge over CAFE standards in regards to cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {Innovative energy and environmental technologies have an important role in achieving carbon neutrality. However, uncertainties regarding the potential of these technologies still remain. For this reason, possible scenarios for such technologies must be developed to facilitate forward-looking decision-making on national energy strategies. This study investigated multiple scenarios of future energy systems in Japan to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 using a MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) energy model. Six cases were configured based on different assumptions of renewable and nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen import, and the CO2 emissions, primary energy supply, final energy consumption, and electricity generation were compared for the different cases. The scenario analysis results suggest that electric power systems in Japan should be fully decarbonized by 2040 in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, implying that renewable power generation should be dominant in the decarbonized electricity sector in Japan. The results also indicate that total energy supply and consumption in 2050 will be between 14.9–15.7 and 9.6–10.2 EJ, respectively, and that 211–256 Mt of CO2 will need to be removed using advanced CO2 removal technologies. The results further imply that CO2 removal technologies will become necessary when industrial decarbonization is difficult.},

Therefore, possible scenarios for the potential of these technologies should be considered to allow for flexible decision-making with respect to long-term energy strategies in Japan. This study evaluates the role of hydrogen in future energy systems in Japan using a MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model. A range of uncertainties are considered for nuclear power generation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) from fossil power generation. Our results suggest that an 80% reduction of CO2 emissions from the 2013 level by 2050 requires emissions from the electricity sector to decrease to nearly zero. Hydrogen power must play a functional role in future energy systems in Japan, but its contribution should depend on nuclear power and CCS.},

In this study, we analyzed the diffusion of energy technologies from energy transition and sustainable resource use perspectives. An energy system analysis was performed to evaluate the future technology stock, energy balance, and CO2 emissions in Japan. Simulation results show that 79.4% of the energy consumed and 94.4% of the CO2 emitted by passenger vehicles could be reduced from 2010 levels by 2050, if the maximum growth rate of electrified vehicles is 17% per year. Meanwhile, for that scenario, material flow analysis suggests that cobalt demand in 2050 would increase to 93.9–174.0 kt, which is 20.9–35.8 times of that in 2020. Recycling of cobalt waste will reduce the cobalt supply and demand gap therefore is critical for sustainable resource use.},

To meet goals of reducing GHG, hydrogen gas can be utilized in power generation in hydrogen fired and firing / co-combustion power plants. This paper analyses the impact of hydrogen in the power generation sector using the MARKAL-TIMES Japan optimization model framework. Two models are used: a base scenario without hydrogen and hydrogen scenario in which hydrogen is supplied from 2020 onwards. In the hydrogen scenario, other processes which are normally supplied by natural gas are reduced because the gas is instead used to generate power. Adding hydrogen to the energy supply leads to a decrease in projected use of fossil fuels. The hydrogen scenario produces fewer emissions than the base scenario; by 2050, the hydrogen scenario's estimated 388 metric tons of CO2 emissions is over 250 tons less than the base scenario's emissions of 588 metric tons.},

To estimate the financial effort required to achieve this target we analyse two long-term scenarios developed by the Paul Scherrer Institute and the World Energy Council, which describe two alternative economic and energy system developments. We focus on developing Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, which currently have the largest percentage of population without access to electricity. We couple a long-term energy system model with regional econometric models that forecast population electrification rates.

By performing a Monte-Carlo Analysis with the detailed ETSAP-TIAM Integrated Assessment Model and by generating 4000 scenarios of the world's energy system, climate and economy, we find that the uncertainty surrounding technology costs, resource potentials, climate sensitivity and the level of decoupling between energy demands and economic growth influence the efficiency of climate policies and accentuate investment risks in clean energy technologies. Contrary to other studies relying on exploring the uncertainty space via model intercomparison, we find that the CO 2 emissions and CO 2 prices vary convexly and nonlinearly with the discount rate and climate sensitivity over time. Accounting for this uncertainty is important for designing climate policies and carbon prices to accelerate the transition. In 70% of the scenarios, a 1.5 • C temperature overshoot was within this decade, calling for immediate policy action. Delaying this action by ten years may result in 2 • C mitigation costs being similar to those required to reach the 1.5 • C target if started today, with an immediate peak in emissions, a larger uncertainty in the medium-term horizon and a higher effort for net-zero emissions.},

We quantify a number of “what-if” scenarios using a cost-optimisation bottom-up model, with detailed representation of biomass production and use pathways, electricity and heat sectors, and grid ancillary services markets. The scenario analysis shows that domestic biomass can contribute 5–7% in electricity and 14–21% in heat production by 2050, depending on natural gas prices and climate policy intensity. Pooling of biogenic driven cogeneration plants can provide about 22–44% of the total secondary control power in 2050.

Most of existing urban energy platforms are focused on short-term analysis (present or 2020) and cover specific sectors and/or aspects, without considering the holistic optimisation of the whole energy system. Moreover, usually these platforms can only be operated by users with high technical skills. This article presents the design and development of the innovative SureCity Platform which aims to overcome existing gaps to support cities to achieve their mid-to-long term sustainability targets. The main novelties the SureCity platform are: (i) it is a transparent and user-friendly software which can also be used by non-technical staff, such as politicians; (ii) it allows assessment of urban policies and measures through holistic optimisation of the whole energy system towards low carbon energy systems including air quality, land-use and water use at city level. Furthermore, since it is based on a generic comprehensive model, the SureCity platform can be adjusted and applied to a large number of cities. Because it is generalised, it has been developed using a participatory approach with different city stakeholders, and since it is designed to be used by users with different levels of expertise, it can also improve communication among city actors and benchmarking with other cities.},

Economic potential against the baseline scenario through market competition between existing and high efficient technologies is 5.6% for energy saving and 6.1% for CO2reduction by 2035. CO2reduction potential is higher than energy-saving potential because fuel substitution toward gas was added to the energy-saving effect due to efficiency improvement.

As one of the key measures for promoting the deployment of renewable energy, the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which obligates power operators with a power equipment capacity of 500 MW or larger (excluding renewable energy equipment) to supply over a specific portion of their total electricity generation output in the form of renewable energy, was enacted in South Korea in 2012. However, there are still many disputes concerning the appropriate renewable energy deployment goal and the optimum portfolio for each renewable energy source which enable to minimize the economic burden while achieving the deployment target. Therefore, this paper intends to deduce the optimum portfolio up to 2050 based on explicit representation of renewable energy technologies and analyze the cost effect using the bottom-up energy system analysis model of electricity generation sector in South Korea. The result indicates that the potential for a reduction of the cost of PV was the highest and that, in the long term, it would account for the highest portion of the renewable energy portfolio as it was the most cost competitive technology. The additional cost for increasing the renewable deployment target 20% compared with the 3rd Energy Basic Plan was predicted to be between 107 and 115 USD/MW h. Therefore the renewable energy will be able to play a greater role in reducing GHG emission if the R&D to reduce investment and operation cost of PV and wind power is conducted successfully.},

We first identified six technology policy options already adopted or being considered for adoption by the Korean government in the near future. Next, we quantitatively analyzed the GHG emission mitigation potential of each option, as well as the combination of all the options, via the best-known and most widely used bottom-up energy system model. In addition, we estimated the marginal mitigation costs of the options and their combination. We found that more than 30% of GHG emissions can be reduced compared to the business-as-usual scenario by adopting technology options, and that most reductions can be achieved by the road transportation subsector. We also showed that a comprehensive analysis is required to estimate the total potential of the entire transportation sector, because some duplication effects exist between the options. Lastly, based on the comprehensive analysis results, we provide four implications of the plan for climate change and transportation policy makers.},

Natural gas and oil fields are the plentiful domestic energy resources in the Gulf of Thailand, but are projected to be available only in the next decade. Using domestic natural gas would reduce national energy security. Due to its low price, coal will dominate in electricity generation in Thailand. However, more utilization of coal results in increasing CO 2 emissions. To comply with the low-carbon society policy of the Royal Thai Government, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) for the future committed power plants in Thailand is introduced and analysed using the market allocation model, a least-cost energy planning tool. In this study, CO 2 mitigation scenarios include integrated CCS to new gas- and coal-based power plants, nuclear power and renewable-based power plants and these were introduced as mitigation options. In energy-demand forecasting, share of coal-based plants is projected to increase from 0.72% in 2006 to 14.97% in 2030, while the share of gas-based plants decreases from 79.24 to 53.25% in the same period. This study also presents possible gas and oil fields for storing CO 2 in the deep saline aquifer in the Gulf of Thailand.

abstract = {Switzerland and Europe are currently at a crossroads with respect to its electricity policy. Several existing nuclear and fossil fuel power plants are to be retired in the coming years. Meanwhile, ambitious carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions are envisaged, which could penalise fossil power plants and encourage investments in renewable-based electricity generation. Switzerland and a few other countries in Europe have decided to phase-out their nuclear capacity, thereby removing a low-carbon source of electricity in the medium- to long-term future. In order to understand possible electricity transition pathways for Switzerland, electricity supply options for Switzerland and its four neighbouring countries namely Austria, France, Germany and Italy are analysed to assess non-nuclear alternatives under a stringent climate mitigation policy. The cross border Swiss TIMES electricity model (CROSSTEM), a cost optimisation framework with a long time horizon and an hourly temporal resolution, is used for this analysis. In the absence of any CO2 emission reduction targets, gas-based generation supplemented by electricity imports is the cost-effective alternative to nuclear for Switzerland. For a low carbon electricity system, natural gas based generation with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), complemented by an accelerated investment in renewable generation is required. Traditional electricity trade patterns have to be revised, with significant increases in cross-border interconnector capacities necessary to transfer electricity to Switzerland from countries with abundant renewable resources such as Germany and Italy. The average cost of electricity in a decarbonised electricity sector would increase in the range of 30-120% by 2050 compared to today, depending on the scenario assumptions. The availability of CCS technology and the requirement for electricity storage are particularly important to achieve a complete decarbonisation of the electricity sector with a nuclear phase-out.},

abstract = {The relevance of sector coupling is increasing when shifting from the current highly centralised and mainly fossil fuel-based energy system to a more decentralized and renewable energy system. Cross-sectoral linkages are already recognized as a cost-effective decarbonisation strategy that provides significant flexibility to the system. Modelling such cross-sectoral interconnections is thus highly relevant. In this work, these interactions are considered in a long-term perspective by uni-directional soft-linking of two models: JRC-EU-TIMES, a long term planning multisectoral model, and Dispa-SET, a unit commitment and optimal dispatch model covering multiple energy sectors such as power, heating & cooling, transportation etc. The impact of sector coupling in future Europe-wide energy systems with high shares of renewables is evaluated through five scenarios. Results show that the contributions of individual sectors are quite diverse. The transport sector provides the highest flexibility potential in terms of power curtailment, load shedding, congestion in the interconnection lines and resulting greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Nevertheless, allowing combinations of multiple flexibility options such as hydro for the long-term, electric vehicles and flexible thermal units for the short-term provides the best solution in terms of system adequacy, greenhouse gas emissions and operational costs.},

Consumer behavior changes in transportation are underrepresented in energy policies, even if they could be essential to achieve the fixed GHG emission reduction targets. To help quantify the role of behaviors in energy transition and their implications on the dynamics of an energy system, this study is conducted using the North American TIMES Energy Model, adapted to Quebec (Canada). A behavioral disruption scenario (an increase in carpooling) is introduced in the model's transportation sector and is compared to a massive electrification scenario. Our results highlight the fact that a behavioral disruption can lead to the same GHG emission reductions (65%) by 2050 as an electrification policy, while alleviating different efforts (such as additional electrical capacity and additional costs) associated with massive electrification. Moreover, the results are sensitive to behavior-related parameters, such as social discount rates and car lifetimes.},

abstract = {The freight transportation sector accounted for 10.1% of global emissions and 16.2% of Quebec's greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. In this sector, the most salient yet little explored behavioral change opportunity is the modal shift from heavy trucks to trains. Current model developments are being made so that E4 modelers represent modal choices as endogenous variables in the models. However, if we want to continue to improve the realism of the models, it is important to know if this modeling technique is suitable for a world where radical changes are required. In this study, two types of modal shifts are implemented and compared in a TIMES-type energy model: exogenous modal shifts, with demand-side scenarios, and endogenous modal shifts, with the introduction of substitution elasticities as an endogenous behavioral feature of the model. The results of this study show that only the exogenous approach allows the modeling of disruptions: in demand, in energy consumption, and in system costs. With respect to vehicle type, the exogenous approach avoids investments in complex infrastructure (i.e., catenary), at least in the medium term, while the endogenous approach leads to results where electric trucks and catenaries appear in 2030. Only the scenario with a significant modal shift from heavy trucks to trains (Exog_max) avoids substantial energy consumption (17 PJ in 2030 and 10 PJ in 2050). The concluding recommendation is to use the exogenous approach in a disruptive modeling context. In a world where a paradigm shift is needed, the exogenous approach allows for a better representation of concepts that have been seldom modeled until now.},

abstract = {In the past four decades following the global oil crisis in 1973, Denmark has implemented remarkable changes in its energy sector, mainly due to the energy conservation measures on the demand side and the energy efficiency improvements on the supply side. Nowadays, the capital intensive infrastructure investments, such as the expansion of district heating networks and the introduction of significant heat saving measures require highly detailed decision-support tool. A Danish heat atlas provides highly detailed database with extensive information about more than 2.5 million buildings in Denmark. Energy system analysis tools incorporate environmental, economic, energy and engineering analysis of future energy systems and are considered crucial for the quantitative assessment of transitional scenarios towards future milestones, such as EU 2020 goals and Denmark's goal of achieving fossil free society after 2050. The present paper shows how a Danish heat atlas can be used for providing inputs to energy system models, especially related to the analysis of heat saving measures within building stock and expansion of district heating networks. As a result, marginal cost curves are created, approximated and prepared for the use in optimization energy system model. Moreover, it is concluded that heat atlas can contribute as a tool for data storage and visualisation of results.},

Thus, restructuring current energy system is essential for the realization of low-carbon futures.

This paper reviews and discusses the perspective of low-carbon energy systems in the case of Thailand. It analyzes the projected development of energy system in Thailand. The literature on modeling of energy systems is analyzed and discussed. The paper presents a quantitative comparison of the selected energy model applications in terms of energy demand and energy-related CO2 emissions. The paper explores the potential pathways using findings from existing modeling studies to guide the development of a low-carbon energy system within a backcasting framework. It is found that there are wide ranges of projected emissions paths across the models.

abstract = {The implementation of resource management strategies aimed at reducing the impacts of the anthropogenic activities system requires a comprehensive approach to evaluate on the whole the environmental burdens of productive processes and to identify the best recovery strategies from both an environmental and an economic point of view. In this framework, an analytical methodology based on the integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), ExternE and Comprehensive Analysis was developed to perform an in-depth investigation of energy systems. The LCA methodology, largely utilised by the international scientific community for the assessment of the environmental performances of technologies, combined with Comprehensive Analysis allows modelling the overall system of anthropogenic activities, as well as sub-systems, the economic consequences of the whole set of environmental damages. Moreover, internalising external costs into partial equilibrium models, as those utilised by Comprehensive Analysis, can be useful to identify the best paths for implementing technology innovation and strategies aimed to a more sustainable energy supply and use. This paper presents an integrated application of these three methodologies to a local scale case study (the Val D'Agri area in Basilicata, Southern Italy), aimed to better characterise the environmental impacts of the energy system, with particular reference to extraction activities. The innovative methodological approach utilised takes advantage from the strength points of each methodology with an added value coming from their integration as emphasised by the main results obtained by the scenario analysis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Decarbonizing transport will be necessary to limit global warming below 2°C. Due to persistent reliance on fossil fuels, it is posited that transport is more difficult to decarbonize than other sectors. To test this hypothesis, we compare long-term transport energy demand and emission projections for China, USA and the world from five large-scale energy-economy models. We diagnose the model's characteristics by subjecting them to three climate policies. We systematically analyze mitigation levers along the chain of causality from mobility to emissions, finding that some models lack relevant mitigation options. We partially confirm that transport is less reactive to a given carbon tax than the non-transport sectors: in the first half of the century, transport mitigation is delayed by 10-30 years compared to non-transport mitigation. At high carbon prices towards the end of the century, however, the three global models achieve deep transport emission reductions by >90% through the use of advanced vehicle technologies and low-carbon primary energy; especially biomass with CCS (carbon capture and sequestration) plays a crucial role. The extent to which earlier mitigation is possible strongly depends on implemented technologies and model structure. Compared to the global models, the two partial-equilibrium models are less flexible in their reaction to climate policies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The design of transition pathways for sustainable electricity systems with high penetrations of renewable energy sources requires the use of energy modeling tools that are able to account for two key aspects: the evolution of fossil fuels and technology prices, and the natural dynamics of renewable resources. However, the modeling methodologies most currently used focus on only one of these two aspects, which hinders their suitability for performing long-term analysis with high penetrations of renewable energy sources. This paper presents a modeling framework that is able to optimize the investment in new renewable generation capacity on the long-term while taking into account the hourly dynamics of electricity supply and demand. The framework combines two of the most used energy planning tools, each able to account for one of the aspects of the modeling of energy systems. The framework was applied to continental Portugal for the time period of 2005-2050, in order to identify optimal investment plans in new renewable and fossil generation capacity with the goal of achieving significant CO2 emissions reduction, under different scenarios. The results show that the inclusion of dynamics in the modeling methodology can help avoid overinvestment and reduce the excess of electricity from renewable energy sources that cannot be used by the system. These results can have a significant impact on the design of a sustainable electricity system and may lead to a diversification of the energy sources used. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the intermittence of most renewable resources when renewable energy provides a significant share of the energy mix can create problems to electricity grids, which can be minimized by energy storage systems that are usually not available or expensive. An alternative solution consists on the use of demand side management strategies, which can have the double effect of reducing electricity consumption and allowing greater efficiency and flexibility in the grid management, namely by enabling a better match between supply and demand.This work analyzes the impact of demand side management strategies in the evolution of the electricity mix of Flores Island in the Azores archipelago which is characterized by high shares of renewable energy and therefore the introduction of more renewable energy sources makes it an interesting case study for testing innovative solutions.The electricity generation system is modeled in TIMES, a software which optimizes the investment and operation of wind and hydro plants until 2020 based on scenarios for demand growth, deployment of demand response technologies in the domestic sector and promotion of behavioral changes to eliminate standby power. The results show that demand side management strategies can lead to a significant delay in the investment on new generation capacity from renewable resources and improve the operation of the existing installed capacity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The impact of these policies is usually calculated by energy planning tools. However, the modeling methodologies most currently used are not adequate to simulate long-term scenarios while considering the hourly dynamics of supply and demand. This paper presents an extension of the TIMES energy planning tool for investment decisions in electricity production that considers seasonal, daily and hourly supply and demand dynamics. The inclusion of these dynamics enables the model to produce more accurate results in what concerns the impact of introducing energy efficiency policies and the increased use of renewable energies. The model was validated in S{\~{a}}o Miguel (Azores, Portugal) for the years 2006-2009, where a comparison with real data showed that the model can simulate the supply and demand dynamics. Further, the long-term analysis shows that the inclusion of these dynamics contributes to a better assessment of the renewable energy potential, suggests the postponement of investments in new generation capacity, and demonstrates that using fine time resolution modeling is very valuable for the design of effective policy measures under high renewable penetration energy systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To limit the computational cost, bottom-up long-term (LT) energy-system planning models typically have a stylized temporal representation and do not consider techno-economic operational constraints of power plants. Both these simplifications have been shown to have a significant impact on the results. However, increasing the level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail will result in an increased computational cost. In this regard, the first goal of this work is to quantify which of these simplifications has the highest impact on the results, and should therefore be prioritized for improving. To do so, the impact of both the low level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail are quantified for a varying penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). For a high penetration of IRES, the gains obtained by improving the temporal representation are shown to outweigh the gains obtained by incorporating detailed techno-economic operational constraints. Therefore, improving the temporal representation is suggested to be prioritized. The second goal of this paper is to identify opportunities for model improvements. Different approaches to improve the temporal representation are proposed. While the focus in the literature lies primarily on the impact of the temporal resolution, this work more fundamentally considers and assesses different approaches of dealing with the temporal dimension. Using a different approach of defining the time slices to explicitly account for IRES variability is found to lead to a higher accuracy than can be obtained by simply increasing the temporal resolution, while requiring a lower number of time slices. Moreover, a temporal representation based on selecting a set of representative days can achieve an even higher accuracy, albeit requiring a higher number of time slices. An additional advantage of using representative days is that chronology is retained such that the impact of short-term dynamic fluctuations of IRES can be accounted for.},

abstract = {Central and South America and the Caribbean countries share energy and climate features that are quite different from the rest of the world, including a highly renewable energy mix and very high renewable energy potentials, along with high deforestation and degradation rates which call for regional answers to regional issues. This paper assesses the impact of national contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change using an energy prospective model from the MarkAl/TIMES family. This approach enables a bottom-up comparison between past pledges (Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions) and the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) agreed on at COP21. Long-term economic optimization leads to decarbonizing the power sector even in the absence of climate constraints. Stringent climate policies as modeled here achieve emission reductions of 40% below the current baseline by 2050. NDCs produce stronger emission reductions than NAMAs at regional scale; however, the first contributor to emission reductions in absolute terms in Latin America is the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use (AFOLU) sector, not energy.},

abstract = {In this study we describe a novel formulation of the so-called modelling to generate alternatives (MGA) methodology and use it to explore the near cost optimal solution space of the global energy-environment-economy model TIAM-UCL. Our implementation specifically aims to find maximally different global energy system transition pathways and assess the extent of their diversity in the near optimal region. From this we can determine the stability of the results implied by the least cost pathway which in turn allows us to both identify whether there are any consistent insights that emerge across MGA iterations while at the same time highlighting that energy systems that are very similar in cost can look very different. It is critical that the results of such an uncertainty analysis are communicated to policy makers to aid in robust decision making. To demonstrate the technique we apply it to two scenarios, a business as usual (BAU) case and a climate policy run. For the former we find significant variability in primary energy carrier consumption across the MGA iterations which then projects further into the energy system leading to, for example, large differences in the portfolio of fuels used in and emissions from the electricity sector. When imposing a global emissions constraint we find, in general, less variability than the BAU case. Consistent insights do emerge with oil use in transport being a robust finding across all MGA iterations for both scenarios and, in the mitigation case, the electricity sector is seen to reliably decarbonise before transport and industry as total system cost is permitted to increase. Finally, we compare our implementation of MGA to the so-called Hop-Skip-Jump formulation, which also seeks to obtain maximally different solutions, and find that, when applied in the same way, the former identifies more diverse transition pathways than the latter.},

abstract = {The decarbonisation of the power sector is key to achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global mean surface temperature rise to well below 2 °C. This will require rapid, national level transitions to low carbon electricity generation, such as variable renewables (VRE), nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, across the world. At the same time it is essential that future power systems are sustainable in the wider sense and thus respect social, environmental and technical limitations. Here we develop an energy-land-water nexus modelling framework and use it to perform a scenario analysis with the aim of understanding the planning and operational implications of these constraints on Great Britain's (GB) power system in 2050. We consider plausible scenarios for limits on installed nuclear capacity, siting restrictions that shape VRE deployment and water use for thermal power station cooling. We find that these factors combined can lead to up to a 25% increase in the system's levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). VRE siting restrictions can result in an up to 13% increase in system LCOE as the deployment of onshore wind is limited while nuclear capacity restrictions can drive an up to 17% greater LCOE. We also show that such real-world limitations can cause substantial changes in system design both in terms of the spatial pattern of where generators are located and the capacity mix of the system. Thus we demonstrate the large impact simultaneously considering a set of nexus factors can have on future GB power systems. Finally, given our plausible assumptions about key energy-land-water restrictions and emission limits effecting the GB power system in 2050, the cost optimal penetration of VREs is found to be at least 50%.},

One of the important implications of this reform is that current fuel taxes are decreased to a level of 80 euro/ton of CO2 but that the mileage related taxes on car and truck use increase. Using the TREMOVE model for the transport sector of 31 European countries, one finds that the volume of transport will decrease because current taxes on transport are too low compared to overall external costs. Overall CO2 emissions will decrease slightly. Using the MARKAL-TIMES model for the Belgian energy sector, putting all sectors and technologies on equal footing shows that a fuel tax reform makes that it is not cost efficient to require large CO2 emission reductions in the transport sector and that traditional car technologies will continue to dominate the car market in 2020-2030. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores how one such option, mode shift, can contribute to low-carbon energy systems. For the first time, endogenous mode choice is integrated into a whole energy systems model, ESME, by representing mode speed, travel time budgets, infrastructure costs, and maximum rates of modal shift. Results indicate that the cost-optimal model solution favours sustainable transport modes, although this is strongly contingent on financial disincentives for car travel and measures to make slower modes more attractive. This approach is relevant in many different country contexts, as the need to assess options for lower carbon, more sustainable urban transport systems increases.},

abstract = {The need to reduce CO2 emissions to zero by 2050 has meant an increasing focus on high emitting industrial sectors such as steel. However, significant uncertainties remain as to the rate of technology diffusion across steel production pathways in different regions, and how this might impact on climate ambition. Informed by empirical analysis of historical transitions, this paper presents modelling on the regional deployment of Direction Reduction Iron using hydrogen (DRI-H2). We find that DRI-H2 can play a leading role in the decarbonisation of the sector, leading to near-zero emissions by 2070. Regional spillovers from early to late adopting regions can speed up the rate of deployment of DRI-H2, leading to lower cumulative emissions and system costs. Without such effects, cumulative emissions are 13% higher than if spillovers are assumed and approximately 15% and 20% higher in China and India respectively. Given the estimates of DRI-H2 cost-effectiveness relative to other primary production technologies, we also find that costs increase in the absence of regional spillovers. However, other factors can also have impacts on deployment, emission reductions, and costs, including the composition of the early adopter group, material efficiency improvements and scrap recycling rates. For the sector to achieve decarbonisation, key regions will need to continue to invest in low carbon steel projects, recognising their broader global benefit, and look to develop and strengthen policy coordination on technologies such as DRI-H2.},

abstract = {The Global MARKAL-Model (GMM), a multi-regional "bottom-up" partial equilibrium model of the global energy system with endogenous technological learning, is used to address impacts of internalisation of external costs from power production. This modelling approach imposes additional charges on electricity generation, which reflect the costs of environmental and health damages from local pollutants (SO2, NOx) and climate change, wastes, occupational health, risk of accidents, noise and other burdens. Technologies allowing abatement of pollutants emitted from power plants are rapidly introduced into the energy system, for example, desulphurisation, NOx removal, and CO2 scrubbers. The modelling results indicate substantial changes in the electricity production system in favour of natural gas combined cycle, nuclear power and renewables induced by internalisation of external costs and also efficiency loss due to the use of scrubbers. Structural changes and fuel switching in the electricity sector result in significant reduction of emissions of both local pollution and CO2 over the modelled time period. Strong decarbonisation impact of internalising local externalities suggests that ancillary benefits can be expected from policies directly addressing other issues then CO2 mitigation. Finally, the detailed analysis of the total generation cost of different technologies points out that inclusion of external cost in the price of electricity increases competitiveness of non-fossil generation sources and fossil power plants with emission control. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses the energy system development, the associated CO2 and local pollutant emissions in Nepal and Thailand using the bottom-up cost-minimizing MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) modeling framework under the base case and three different carbon tax scenarios during 2010-2050. Nepal's energy system is dominated by biomass and is estimated to remain the same by 2050, however its share is likely to decrease from 84% to 35% during 2010-2050. A wide increase in the share of petroleum products and hydropower is expected in the energy system of Nepal by 2050. The power generation mix of Nepal would continue to remain hydropower dominant during the planning period, however there would be a small increase in the share of other renewables (i.e. solar and municipal solid waste) by 2050. For Thailand, this study found that the energy system would be driven by coal with the reduction in the combined share of oil and natural gas by 2050. Unlike Nepal, the power sector of Thailand is natural gas dominant, and would continue to remain the same throughout the planning period. Nuclear power generation is estimated to penetrate after 2035 and its share is estimated to increase from 3% in 2035 to 9% in 2050 under the base case. The transport sector is the major contributor in the total CO2 emissions in Nepal while the power sector occupied the largest share in the total CO2 emissions in Thailand in 2010. The transport sector in Nepal would continue to remain the major CO2 emitting sector while the industrial sector in Thailand would be the major CO2 contributor by 2050. Under the carbon tax scenarios, the majority of the CO2 emission reduction would come from the residential sector in Nepal while that from the power sector in Thailand.},

abstract = {Long-term energy systems models have been used extensively in energy planning and climate policy analysis. However, specifically in energy systems optimization models, heterogeneity of consumer preferences for competing energy technologies (e.g., vehicles), has not been adequately represented, leading to behaviorally unrealistic modeling results. This can lead to policy analysis results that are viewed by stakeholders as clearly deficient. This paper shows how heterogeneous consumer behavioral effects can be introduced into these models in the form of perceived disutility costs, to more realistically capture consumer choice in making technology purchase decisions. We developed a novel methodology that incorporates the theory of a classic consumer choice model into a commonly used long-term energy systems modeling framework using a case study of light-duty vehicles. A diverse set of consumer segments (thirty-six) is created to represent observable, identifiable differences in factors such as annual driving distances and attitude towards risks of new technology. Non-monetary or “disutility” costs associated with these factors are introduced to capture the differences in preferences across consumer segments for various technologies. We also create clones within each consumer segment to capture randomly distributed unobservable differences in preferences. We provide and review results for a specific example that includes external factors such as recharging/refueling station availability, battery size of electric vehicles, recharging time and perceived technology risks. Although the example is for light-duty vehicles in the US using a specific modeling system, this approach can be implemented more broadly to model the adoption of consumer technologies in other sectors or regions in similar energy systems modeling frameworks.},

abstract = {Mega structures for CO2 storage, such as the Utsira formation in the North Sea, could theoretically supply CO2 storage capacity for several countries for a period of several decades. Their use could increase the cost-effectiveness of CCS in a region while minimizing opposition from the public to CO2 storage. However, this will not only depend on their potential available capacity to store CO2 flows but also on the cost effectiveness of such an option within national portfolios of mitigation measures. This article shows key results of a research project aiming to assess the potentials and costs of storing CO2 in the Utsira formation for the time period 2015-2050. Countries included in the analysis are Denmark, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The starting point of the analysis are the national MARKAL and TIMES models developed for each country together with the 27 region Pan European TIMES model (PET). In the models scenarios, assumptions and parameters that are not country dependent (e.g. costs related with CO2 capture technology development) have been harmonized. The results indicate that with stringent climate targets, CCS appears as a key mitigation option in the national portfolio of measures. Within the CCS portfolio, storage of CO2 in the Utsira formation can indeed be a cost effective option for North Europe and it represents a valuable CO2 storage option at the regional level. For instance, the United Kingdom will profit from the comparably short transport distance to Utsira while the Netherlands utilise the Utsira formation due to limited domestic low cost storage fields and the use of the country as a regional hub for CO2. In Germany and Denmark, the competitiveness of CO2 storage in Utsira is determined by the availability of domestic onshore saline aquifers. If these aquifers are not used, Utsira gains as competitive storage option. The main limitation for the common use of the Utsira formation appears, from a modeling point of view, to be the maximum annual injection rate for CO2 that has been assumed in the project (150 Mt CO2/yr). {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A dynamic partial equilibrium model, TIMES (​The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System), is built to optimize the energy system in a post-transition European country, the Czech Republic. The impacts of overall nine scenarios on installed capacity, capital and fuel costs, air quality pollutant emission, emission of CO2and environmental and health damage are quantified for a period up to 2050. These scenarios are built around three different price sets of the EUA (EU allowance) to emit greenhouse gasses alongside a policy that retains the ban on brown coal mining in two Czech mines, a policy that will allow the re-opening of mining areas under this ban (i.e. within the territorial ecological limits), and a low natural gas price assumption. We found that the use of up until now dominant brown coal will be significantly reduced in each scenario, although reopening the coal mines will result in its smaller decline. With low EUA price, hard coal will become the dominant fuel in electricity generation, while nuclear will overtake this position with a 51% or even 65% share assuming the central price of EUA, or high EUA price, respectively. The low price of natural gas will result in an increasing gas share from an almost zero share recently up to about 42%. This stimulus does not however appear at all with low EUA price. Neither of these scenarios will achieve the renewable energy sources 2030 targets and only a high EUA price will lead to almost full de-carbonization of the Czech power system, with fossil fuels representing only 16% of the energy mix. The low EUA price will result in an increase in CO2emissions, whereas the high EUA price will reduce CO2emission by at least 81% compared to the 2015 reference level. Those scenarios that will result in CO2emission reduction will also generate ancillary benefits due to reduction in air quality emissions, on average over the entire period, at least at 38€ per t of avoided CO2, whereas scenarios that will lead to CO2increase will generate ancillary costs at least of 31€ per t CO2.},

abstract = {In response to massive destruction of the landscape and significant air pollution due to brown coal mining and usage, in 1991 the Czech Government set territorial limits for brown coal mining in the North Bohemia coal basin (the ‘Territorial Environmental Limits'). In 2015, however, this 24-year-old prohibition was lifted at one of two open pit mines under the ban and, as a consequence, some of its reserves of brown coal may be mined in future. We use the regional technology-rich energy system optimization model, TIMES, to analyse the impacts of maintaining the ban versus three options for less environmentally stringent mining policies – the policy adopted in 2015 and two additional policy propositions which would further lift the ban at the second open pit mine, which have not been rejected by the Czech government. We evaluate the effects of these four policy options on the Czech energy system, the costs of generating energy, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and related external environmental and health costs up to 2050. We find that none of the three new policy variants jeopardizes achievement of the 2030 carbon reduction targets. However, the 2050 80% carbon reduction target may not be achievable in any case – the projected reductions range between 66 and 71%, and only maintaining the 1991 ban could reduce this gap, whereas the two policies under discussion would mean that reaching this target would be even more challenging. The newly adopted 2015 policy will lead to at least 709 PJ more brown coal use and up to 85 Mt more greenhouse gases emissions by 2050. The additional supply of brown coal made available by lifting the limits will exceed domestic demand. Brown coal that will be burnt in domestic power plants will lead to additional external costs due to adverse impacts on the environment and human health of up to €306 million.},

abstract = {The urgency to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050, as first presented by the IPCC special report on 1.5 °C Global Warming, has spurred renewed interest in hydrogen, to complement electrification, for widespread decarbonization of the economy. We present reflections on estimates of future hydrogen demand, optimization of infrastructure for hydrogen production, transport and storage, development of viable business cases, and environmental impact evaluations using life cycle assessments. We highlight challenges and opportunities that are common across studies of the business cases for hydrogen in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway. The use of hydrogen in the industrial sector is an important driver and could incentivise large-scale hydrogen value chains. In the long-term hydrogen becomes important also for the transport sector. Hydrogen production from natural gas with capture and permanent storage of the produced CO2 (CCS) enables large-scale hydrogen production in the intermediate future and is complementary to hydrogen from renewable power. Furthermore, timely establishment of hydrogen and CO2 infrastructures serves as an anchor to support the deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, such as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and biohydrogen production with CCS. Significant public support is needed to ensure coordinated planning, governance, and the establishment of supportive regulatory frameworks which foster the growth of hydrogen markets.},

This has been achieved by presenting for a first time results on options for technology deployment, energy system development and cost-estimates for adapting the European energy conversion sector to climate change as well as presenting results for stringent mitigation scenarios, including analyses of different policy and technological uncertainties. In the sce- nario analysis of adaptation, it has been found that especially southern Europe needs to prepare for warmer climate. It has been found that ex- pected higher water temperatures of rivers are likely to decrease availabil- ity and efficiency of thermal power plants, and that reduced river runoff is likely to decrease the output of hydro power in the future, under a warmer climate. To cope with such instances, costly investments in advanced cooling technologies are mandatory in southern Europe. Nordic Euro- pean countries on the other hand may profit from warmer temperatures, decreasing the energy consumption for space heating, and an increased precipitation is likely to favor additional output of hydro power. However, in this study, the impacts of extreme and uncertain weather events based on climate change were not considered, potentially adding to the need for costly adaptation measures.},

Due to the European obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, the trend toward natural gas is expected to continue in the future. The increased consumption is faced by comparably low indigenous gas resources within Europe, so that the dependency of Europe on gas imports from abroad will rise in the future. In addition to the existing supply sources Russia and Algeria, gas resources from the Middle East and the Caspian and the Central Asian regions may be supply options to cover Europe's gas demand in the future. Against this background, possible natural gas supply options as well as the transport infrastructure to and within Europe are discussed regarding their technical capacity and their costs. With the help of a cost-minimization model of the European gas supply system, the gas flows and the infrastructure capacity development up to the year 2030 are analyzed.

abstract = {Sustainable energy consumption is a research area of a large interest in last years. New energy-efficient lighting technologies exist, which can significantly reduce household electricity consumption, but their adoption has been slow. A considerable number of international studies show that sustainable development scenarios will be realistic if they involve the human behavior. The paper provides a solution to integrate consumer behavior with techno-economic energy issues, inside a complex energy model. This approach aims to reduce the error, from the demand side of the energy model. Consumer behavior in energy consumption is described by using specific attributes of energy technologies, namely virtual technologies. The GAMS/TIMES/VEDA energy modelling software tool has been used to integrate the techno-economic energy specific data and consumer behavior, in order to achieve the research purposes. A sociological survey about Romanians' behavior in energy consumption has been conducted and its results have been integrated in the energy based model, in form of virtual technologies. This approach, known as "Social MARKAL", allows the analyst to evaluate the possible contribution of information campaigns in changing lighting consumers' behavior and effect of technology switch. The model is developed for the period 2010-2026, and is implemented by using GAMS/TIMES/VEDA software platform. The results presented this paper focuses on the household lighting technologies.},

Three scenarios, including Reference Case, Current Policy, and Paris Agreement are reviewed. Reference case system will be 77% dominated by unabated coal power plant, and Current Policy will only reduce its share by 10% in 2050. Furthermore, the emissions from these scenarios are still half of estimated electricity emission in NDC due to different demand level between the policy target and current level indicating the ambition gap. Achieving well below 2°C long-term target, 50% of RE and 40% of IGCC-CCS in electricity production are needed. There will be 48% increase in investment compare to reference case and constant electricity production to current level. Uncertainty of carbon budget will not shift the emission peak or penetration of solar PV utility-scale, but will greatly affect the deployment time, as soon as 2030 or as later as 2040, and capacity of IGCC-CCS and the presence of BECCS up to 2050.

From this study, it can be concluded that nuclear and solar PV utility-scale will play an essential role up to 16% and 70% of total electricity production, corresponding to 1396 TWh in 2050. The investment cost in 2050 is three times higher, and the emission is one-sixth lower than in Business as Usual, equal to 95 billion USD and 215 million tons of CO2-eq.

This alternative offers a unique opportunity for a net removal of atmospheric CO2 while fulfilling energy needs. Empirical studies using bottom-up energy models show that BECCS has an important role to play in the future energy mix. Most of these studies focus on global BECCS potential, whereas it is of interest to understand where this mitigation option will be deployed. This key issue will strongly depend on regions' biomass resources and possession of storage sites. The aim of this study is to assess the global and regional potential of BECCS up to 2050 in power generation. This analysis is conducted using the multiregional TIAM-FR optimization model. The climate policy scenarios investigated lead to a considerable expansion of renewable energy and CCS and BECCS technologies in the power sector.

Our findings suggest that the stochastic modelling approach is critical in particular for studies of remote Arctic energy systems. Furthermore, the results from a case study of the Norwegian settlement of Longyearbyen, suggest that transitioning to a system based on renewable energy sources is feasible.

abstract = {Integration of variable renewables such as solar and wind has grown at an unprecedented pace in Europe over the past two decades. As the share of solar and wind rises, it becomes increasingly important for long-term energy system models to adequately represent their short-term variability. This paper uses a long-term TIMES model of the European power and district heat sectors towards 2050 to explore how stochastic modelling of short-term solar and wind variability as well as different temporal resolutions influence the model performance. Using a stochastic model with 48 time-slices as benchmark, the results show that deterministic models with low temporal resolution give a 15–20% underestimation of annual costs, an overestimation of the contribution of variable renewables (13–15% of total electricity generation) and a lack of system flexibility. The results of the deterministic models converge towards the stochastic solution when the temporal resolution is increased, but even with 2016 time-slices, the need for flexibility is underestimated. In addition, the deterministic model with 2016 time-slices takes 30 times longer to solve than the stochastic model with 48 time-slices. Based on these findings, a stochastic approach is recommended for long-term studies of energy systems with large shares of variable renewable energy sources.},

The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},

The Power-to-Gas technology of interest is the low-temperature co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O, which is an emerging technology for electrochemically converting them to syngas. Particularly, excess electricity available from intermittent renewable energy resources is intended to be the main energy source for the co-electrolysis. A conceptual design of the co-electrolysis process is carried out to calculate its performance data including mass balances, energy demand, and capital investment. Based on them, a temporal energy system model is developed using the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model generator. The conclusion is that deploying the co-electrolysis process in the Korean power generation sector can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also save the overall system cost when the syngas production cost is lower than the purchasing cost of liquid natural gas. The beneficial impacts are limited by the amount of available excess electricity and the co-firing ratio limit in the gas-fired power plants. Finally, the overpotential and current density, as uncertain parameters of the co-electrolysis process, are found to affect the syngas production cost most strongly.},

The electricity from the CHP plants is supplied to the municipality but can also be sold to the electricity market, and electricity can, of course, also be bought from the market. The variation in price on the spot market over any given day is significant. The need for district heat in the building stock also varies, for example due to climatic conditions.

abstract = {The impact assessment of energy strategies, more specifically those that promote an integrated approach on resource management in other sectors such as water and food, requires knowledge related to the evaluation of the quality and knowledge that may be estimated by quantitative means. The present paper makes inquiries into those knowledge requirements in addition to review the means used to obtain it—including the required entries and the results they provide. In response to the recognized problems in knowledge, this paper introduces a basic reference structure underlying a system to evaluate the way that a progressive development of inexhaustible energies in a particular geographical region can affect the demand of water and food. Then, the proposed conceptual framework constitutes a novel approach for energy policy makers which only consider partial impacts of the energy management. By considering the nexus of energy, water and food, energy management policies may be redefined and differences with current policies must be investigated.},

abstract = {The development of the energy system model IFE-TIMES-Norway started in 2017 in cooperation with Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). This report describes the model version 1 from September 2020. It is based on earlier versions of TIMES-Norway (2009) and MARKAL-Norway (1992). The model development is dynamic with continuously methodological developments and updates of input data. IFE-TIMES-Norway is a long-term optimisation model of the Norwegian energy system that is generated by TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) modelling framework. TIMES is a bottom-up framework that provides a detailed techno-economic description of resources, energy carriers, conversion technologies and energy demand. TIMES models provide investments and operational decisions that minimize the total discounted cost of a given energy system that meets the future demand for energy services. The total energy system cost includes investment costs in both supply and demand technologies, operation and maintenance costs, and income from electricity export to and costs of electricity import from countries outside Norway. IFE-TIMES-Norway is a technology-rich model of the Norwegian energy system that is divided into five regions that corresponds to the current spot price areas of the electricity market. The model provides operational and investment decisions from the starting year, 2018, towards 2050, with model periods for every fifth year from 2020 within this model horizon. To capture operational variations in energy generation and end-use, each model period is split into 96 sub-annual time slices, where four seasons is represented by 24 hours each. The model has a detailed description of end-use of energy, and the demand for energy services is divided into numerous end-use categories within industry, buildings and transport. Prepared},

If the national targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases should be met, a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions has to be obtained from the transport sector. This paper presents the results of the analyses of three Norwegian regions with the energy system model MARKAL during the period 2005-2050. The MARKAL models were used in connection with an infrastructure model H2INVEST. The analyses show that a transition to a hydrogen fuelled transportation sector could be feasible in the long run, and indicate that with substantial hydrogen distribution efforts, fuel cell cars can become competitive compared to other technologies both in urban (2025) and rural areas (2030). In addition, the result shows the importance of the availability of local energy resources for hydrogen production, like the advantages of location close to chemical industry or surplus of renewable electricity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Professor T.

abstract = {Projections of energy demand are an important part of analyses of policies to promote conservation, efficiency, technology implementation and renewable energy production. The development of energy demand is a key driver of the future energy system. This paper presents long-term projections of the Norwegian energy demand as a two-step methodology of first using activities and intensities to calculate a demand of energy services, and secondly use this as input to the energy system model TIMES-Norway to optimize the Norwegian energy system. Long-term energy demand projections are uncertain and the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the impact of different projections on the energy system. The results of the analyses show that decreased energy demand results in a higher renewable fraction compared to an increased demand, and the renewable energy production increases with increased energy demand. The most profitable solution to cover increased demand is to increase the use of bio energy and to implement energy efficiency measures. To increase the wind power production, an increased renewable target or higher electricity export prices have to be fulfilled, in combination with more electricity export. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

When analyzing these technologies in an integrated assessment model using endogenous technological learning, the uncertainty in the assumed learning rates (LRs) plays a crucial role in the production-cost development and model outcomes. This study examines the uncertainty in LRs of some energy technologies under endogenous global learning implementation and presents a floor-cost modeling procedure to systematically regulate the uncertainty in LRs of energy technologies. The article narrates the difficulties of data assimilation, as compatible with mixed integer programming segmentations, and comprehensively presents the causes of uncertainty in LRs. This work is executed using a multi-regional and long-horizon energy system model based on "TIMES" framework. All regions receive an economic advantage to learn in a common domain, and resource-ample regions obtain a marginal advantage for better exploitation of the learning technologies, due to a lower supply-side fuel-cost development. The lowest learning investment associated with the maximum LR mobilizes more deployment of the learning technologies. The uncertainty in LRs has an impact on the diffusion of energy technologies tested, and therefore this study scrutinizes the role of policy support for some of the technologies investigated.

Further the process of evaluation gains interest especially by endogenous treatment of energy technologies under uncertainty in learning rates with technology gap across the regions in global regional cluster learning approach. This work devised, implemented, and examined new methodologies on technology gaps (a practical problem), using two broad concepts of knowledge deficit and time lag approaches in global learning, applying the floor cost approach methodology. The study was executed in a multi-regional, technology-rich and long horizon bottom-up linear energy system model on The Integrated MARKAL EFOM System (TIMES) framework. Global learning selects highest learning technologies in maximum uncertainty of learning rate scenario, whereas any form of technology gap retards the global learning process and discourages the technologies deployment. Time lag notions of technology gaps prefer heavy utilization of learning technologies in developed economies for early reduction of specific cost. Technology gaps of any kind should be reduced among economies through the promotion and enactment of various policies by governments, in order to utilize the technological resources by mass deployment to combat ongoing climate change.

This paper seeks to address those gaps on sectoral energy demands and emissions on long term by following a two-stage approach. It develops key energy indicators on useful energy demand, transport mobility and end use fuel demand for various sectors. The main drivers of these indicators are socio-economic parameters. The indicators are used to project energy service demands and emissions forward for China in TIMES G5 model at least cost approach. The results from this reference scenario suggest that China will require approximately 4 Gtoe of primary energy, by the end of the 21st century to deliver 3 Gtoe final energy consumption, 10 PWh of electricity generation, 1.3 Gtoe of energy imports, which will results in 10 Gt CO2 emissions. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Two methodological approaches were developed following the modelling principles of attributional and consequential life cycle assessment (LCA). The methodology is illustrated using a simple case study: a low-energy single family house located in France. Two design options were evaluated using life cycle assessment: the choice of a heating system and the integration of photovoltaic (PV) modules on the roof. Using an attributional approach and compared to a static LCA considering no prospective parameters, the carbon footprint of the house (total life cycle) varies from +21% to +43% for the electric heating alternative, −7% to +4% for the gas boiler alternative, −6% to +15% for the PV alternative depending on climate change intensity and evolution of the energy mix. Figures using the consequential approach have a larger magnitude of variation from −36% to −13% for the electric heating alternative, 0 to +16% for the gas boiler alternative and −14% to +1% for the PV alternative compared to a static LCA. Accounting for climate change and the evolution of the energy system has a large influence on LCA results.},

abstract = {Electricity-based mobility (EBM) refers to vehicles that use electricity as their primary energy source either directly such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or indirectly such as hydrogen (H2) driven Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) or Synthetic Natural Gas Vehicles (SNG-V). If low-carbon electricity is used, EBM has the potential to be more sustainable than conventional fossil-fuel based vehicles. While BEV feature the highest tank-to-wheel efficiency, electricity can only be stored for short durations in the energy system (e.g. via pumped-hydro storage or batteries), whereas H2-FCEV and SNG-V have a lower tank-to-wheel efficiency due to additional conversion losses, H2 and SNG can be stored longer in pressurized tanks or the natural gas grid. Thus, they feature more flexibility with regard to exploiting renewable electricity via seasonal storage. In this study, we examine whether and under what circumstances this additional flexibility of H2 and SNG can be used to offset additional losses in the powertrain and conversion with respect to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation of EBM from a life-cycle point of view in a Swiss scenario setting. To this end, a supply chain model for EBM fuels is established in the context of an evolving Swiss and European electricity system along with an approach to estimate the penetration of EBM in a legislation compliant future passenger cars fleet. We show that EBM results in significantly lower life-cycle GHG emissions than a corresponding fossil fuels driven fleet. BEV generally entail the lowest GHG emissions if flexibility options can be offered through sector coupling, short-term and seasonal energy storage or demand side management. Otherwise, in particular with a large expansion of photovoltaics (PV) and curtailment of excess electricity, H2-FCEV and SNG-V feature equal or – in case of high-carbon electricity imports – even lower GHG emissions than BEV.},

In this context, it is important to ensure transparency in the assumptions: making available the underlying data to the public is thus an important step that can also further contribute to a scientific and transparent debate. This report is the first in a series, and addresses the quantification of current and future biomass potentials for energy. As already identified in the 2011 European Commission's Communication Energy roadmap 2050, biomass is expected to play a key role in strengthening the Energy Union pillars by diversifying the energy supply, increasing the energy internal market, decarbonising the economy and boosting competitiveness. Estimating the technical potentials available in EU countries using state of the art methodologies and updated data is important to fully understand the implications of an increased used of biomass for energy. Acknowledging this relevance, much work has been carried to characterise and quantify biomass resources. Building on the initial effort from the European Environment Agency, followed by key projects like BEE and Biomass Futures, this report presents the results of extending and improving current methodologies and estimation to respond to energy system modelling needs, while extending the projections to 2050.},

abstract = {For many years, energy models have been used in developed or developing countries to satisfy different needs in energy planning. One of major problems against energy planning and consequently energy models is uncertainty, spread in different economic, political and legal dimensions of energy planning. Confronting uncertainty, energy planners have often used two well-known strategies. The first strategy is stochastic programming, in which energy system planners define different scenarios and apply an explicit probability of occurrence to each scenario. The second strategy is Minimax Regret strategy that minimizes regrets of different decisions made in energy planning. Although these strategies have been used extensively, they could not flexibly and effectively deal with the uncertainties caused by fuzziness. "Fuzzy Linear Programming (FLP)" is a strategy that can take fuzziness into account. This paper tries to demonstrate the method of application of FLP for optimization of supply energy system in Iran, as a case study. The used FLP model comprises fuzzy coefficients for investment costs. Following the mentioned purpose, it is realized that FLP is an easy and flexible approach that can be a serious competitor for other confronting uncertainties approaches, i.e. stochastic and Minimax Regret strategies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the Nordics, transportation accounts for almost 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions, a higher share than most European countries. The International Energy Agency identifies modal shift as pivotal for a sustainable transition of the transport sector. This study analyses the role of modal shift in the decarbonisation of the Scandinavian energy system with TIMES-Nordic, the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model depicting the national energy systems of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. For the first time, passenger and freight modal shift is modelled through substitution elasticities for a real case study. Transport elasticities from the literature are discussed in light of the modelling environment, and long-term direct elasticities are identified as suitable for the purpose. The results obtained with TIMES-Nordic and its version equipped with modal shift are compared under an increasing CO2 tax. For passenger, car is mainly substituted by rail and non-motorised modes, while for freight, rail replaces truck and ship. Modal shift results in a cost-effective mitigation measure, responsible for 26 PJ of lower fuel consumption in 2050, and 2.2% lower cumulative CO2 emissions from transport. A sensitivity analysis on the investment costs for electric cars reveals the ineffectiveness of the CO2 tax in stimulating car substitution in a future where electric cars are more competitive and the power sector almost decarbonised. Estimates of modal shift potentials from alternative methodologies are comparable to the results obtained, highlighting the methodology solidity.

abstract = {Several efforts have been directed lately towards the endogenisation of transport modes competition in Energy/Economy/Environment/Engineering (E4) models. TIMES-DKEMS is a novel methodology paving the way for applying elasticities of substitution to incorporate transport modal shift into TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) models. Substitution elasticities are defined for four transport demand aggregates, each corresponding to a different distance range class. Within an aggregate, modal demands can adjust their levels according to the defined substitution elasticity and in response to changes of their shadow prices relative to a reference case. The total volume of the transport demand over the aggregate is conserved and modal shift potentials are implemented to guarantee realistic dynamics. The behavior of TIMES-DKEMS is tested under an arbitrary environmental policy, an increasingly stringent bound on CO2 emissions. Modal shares are compared with the standard version of TIMES-DK. Results show that in 2050, 11% of car mobility demand is substituted by more efficient and less costly modes such as train and coach. A sensitivity analysis on the values of substitution elasticities indicates that higher absolute values correspond to larger modal shift. Finally, other model constraints, such as mode-specific travel patterns, interact with the substitution mechanism resulting in a modal shift containment.},

abstract = {Industry is responsible for approximately 30% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases, both globally and in Sweden. Given the climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement, industry is facing a challenging future, requiring effective policies to aid the transition. Energy system optimisation models are commonly used for analysing the impact of different policies and for assessing the transition to a climate-neutral energy system. Traditionally, the primary focus of the models has been on the stationary energy sector, with little on industry. This thesis work, therefore, aims to improve energy system optimisation models as a tool for decision support and policy analysis around industry. An improved modelling structure of the industrial sector is developed and a wide range of future technology options that can support the transition to a climate-neutral sector is identified. The improved model is then applied in various scenario analyses, assessing how Swedish industry can meet net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in spite of resource limitations. The methodology applied is energy system analysis, with a focus on modelling through an iterative process of: i) model conceptualisation, ii) model computation and iii) model result interpretation. Two different models for the evaluation of Swedish industry are developed and used: a model based on ‘The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System' – or TIMES (for cost minimisation) and a small linear optimisation model (for resource optimisation). Through the development of the model structure, it was found that three important aspects need to be represented in the model to capture the transition to a climate-neutral industrial sector: i) synergies between different types of industrial processes; ii) setup of process chains based on important tradable materials; and iii) detailed technology representation. When identifying and analysing future technologies, it was concluded that there are plenty of technology options for Swedish industry to become fossil-energy free. Technology options were identified that enable all the types industries studied (representing approximately 92% of the CO2 emissions from Swedish industry in 2015) to reach net-zero CO2 emission via either electrification (direct electrical heating or indirectly via power-to-gas technologies) or biofuels usage. Options for carbon capture and storage (CCS) were implemented for the iron and steel, chemical, cement and limestone, and aluminium industries, and for most of the industrial energy-conversion technologies. Although technology options for deep reductions in CO2 emissions exist, many of them vi require further development to enable full-scale implementation, as concluded in Paper III (appended to this thesis). The scenario analyses performed in Papers I and II give insights into key resources and technologies enabling Swedish industry to reach net-zero CO2 emission. Concerning resources, biomass is shown to be the most costeffective option for reaching ambitious climate targets; the findings in Paper II show biomass to be consistently preferred over electrified alternatives. However, the availability of biomass is limited, and increased electrification of technologies is unavoidable to achieve sustainable use of biomass (Papers I and II). Finally, there is not one key enabling technology, but rather key groups of enabling technologies that create cross-technology synergies. These provide different benefits depending on resource availability and the overall needs of the system in different scenarios.},

abstract = {There is great uncertainty about what technologies will be available in time to meet Sweden's 2045 net-zero emission target for the industrial sector. This study therefore investigated how the availability of innovative technologies affects cost-effective pathways to meeting this target. The investigation employed scenario analyses using TIMES-Sweden with a new techno-economic database of industrial technologies. The scenarios varied according to how the net-zero target was defined and which technologies could be used to meet the target. Technology readiness levels (TRLs) were used to define which and when new technologies were available for investments. Based on the scenario results, a technology prioritisation pattern was identified, indicating the conditions under which technology options generated cost-efficient solutions from a systems perspective. If carbon offsetting was allowed, then carbon capture and storage (CCS) was promoted, using biofuels as a supplement. When carbon offsetting was restricted, technologies using biofuels and/or electrification options were preferred. In all scenarios, the use of heat pumps and the integration of biofuel production in the forest industry, for example, strengthened sector coupling and were favoured for the efficient use of biomass. The results also revealed that a net-zero industry with restricted use of carbon offsetting relies on technologies with a TRL of 6 (on a scale of 9) to become available; in such cases, hydrogen electrolysis and black liquor gasification were key. When carbon offsetting was unrestricted, CCS technologies combined with low-cost negative emissions provided the most cost-efficient solution, but it led to fossil fuel lock-in. For Sweden, the local availability of biomass provides a competitive advantage when the use and production of biofuels both reduces the need for using more costly power-to-fuel solutions in industry and makes available low-cost negative emissions.},

The choice between these options affects the energy supply systems and their carbon emissions far beyond the LEB area. We compare the long-term systems impacts of the three heat-supply options through dynamic modelling of the energy systems. The study draws on data collected from a real LEB area in Sweden and addresses scale-dependent impacts on district heating systems. The results show that, generally, the individual and on-site options increase biomass and electricity use, respectively. This, in turn, increases carbon emissions in a broader systems perspective.

Consequently, new building areas are constructed based on low-energy building (LEB) standards. These buildings require space heating on cold days and hot water generally. In this study a dynamic energy system optimization model (TIMES model) is applied from the perspective of the Nordic region's energy system. Scenarios were designed and they were integrated into the model to assess energy system impacts of heat supply options to LEBs at the national level in the long term while also addressing the climate targets. The results showed that energy flows and technologies in the heat and power sector depend on the choice of heat supply options to LEBs. These in turn affect the total cost of the entire energy system in Sweden as it fulfills its energy and climate goals. In this paper it was determined that a decentralized low-temperature district heat (DH) supply to LEB areas in Sweden could lead to higher utilization of large-scale heat pumps (HPs) and excess heat (EH) while decreasing system costs and consumption of the electricity used for heating buildings.},

Some of the major conclusions are as follows:. •By 2030, with no government intervention, corn ethanol reaches about 15 bil. gal.(57 bil. liters), and thermochemical biofuel reaches 13 bil. gal.(49 bil. liters) for a combined 28 bil. gal.(106 bil. liters) by 2030.•When the RFS is added to the reference case, there is a substantial increase in both corn ethanol and thermochemical biofuel (about 6 bil. gal.(23 bil. liters) total) in the early years when the RFS is binding.•When combined coal-biomass technology is enabled for the reference (market) case, there is a huge increase in thermochemical biofuel after 2020.•When the RFS is added to the case with combined coal-biomass technology, the main impact is in the early years when the RFS is binding.•The average cost of the binding RFS compared with the reference case is 33 ¢/gal.(9 ¢/liter) in 2015 and 12 to 14 ¢/gal. after that. For the coal-biomass cases, the cost is 24 ¢/gal.(6 ¢/liter) in 2015 and zero after that.•Corn stover is generally less expensive, and it is used exclusively in the early years. As production ratchets up substantially in 2025 or 2030, more dedicated energy crops are used.We have demonstrated that the standard MARKAL results can be considerably enhanced by combining richer information on the land supply data from GTAP into MARKAL.

Bottom-up and top-down modeling approaches find widespread use in energy economic modeling and policy analysis, in which they differ mainly with respect to the emphasis placed on technology of the energy system and/or the comprehensiveness of endogenous market adjustments. For this study, we use a hybrid energy modeling approach, MARKAL-Macro, that combines the characteristics of two divergent approaches, in order to investigate and quantify the cost of climate policies for the US and an equivalent carbon tax. The approach incorporates Macro-economic feedbacks through a single sector neoclassical growth model while maintaining sectoral and technological detail of the bottom-up optimization framework with endogenous aggregated energy demand. Our analysis is done for two important objectives of the US energy policy: GHG reduction and increased energy security. Our results suggest that the emission tax achieves results quite similar to the CES policy but very different results in the transportation sector. The CAFE standard and RFS are more expensive than a carbon tax for emission reductions. However, the CAFE standard and RFS are much more efficient at achieving crude oil import reductions. The GDP losses are 2.0% and 1.2% relative to the base case for the policy case and carbon tax. That difference may be perceived as being small given the increased energy security gained from the CAFE and RFS policy measures and the uncertainty inherent in this type of analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Nuclear energy was assumed to apply for synthetic fuel production as well as for conventional electric power generation. By comparing the CO2 emissions and system costs between these energy scenarios, following results were obtained. Without nuclear energy, the CO2 emissions will hardly be reduced because of substantial increases in coal utilization. CO2 disposal will be effective in reducing the emissions, however at much higher costs than the case with nuclear energy. The expansion of natural gas imports, if alone, will not reduce the emissions at enough low levels. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Limiting global warming to prevent dangerous climate change requires drastically reducing global greenhouse gases emissions and a transformation towards a low-carbon society. Existing energy- and climate-economic modeling approaches that are informing policy and decision makers in shaping the future net-zero emissions society are increasingly seen with skepticism regarding their ability to forecast the long-term evolution of highly complex, nonlinear social-ecological systems. We present a structured review of state-of-the-art modeling approaches, focusing on their ability and limitations to develop and assess pathways towards a low-carbon society. We find that existing methodological approaches have some fundamental deficiencies that limit their potential to understand the subtleties of long-term low-carbon transformation processes. We suggest that a useful methodological framework has to move beyond current state of the art techniques and has to simultaneously fulfill the following requirements: (1) representation of an inherent dynamic analysis, describing and investigating explicitly the path between different states of system variables, (2) specification of details in the energy cascade, in particular the central role of functionalities and services that are provided by the interaction of energy flows and corresponding stock variables, (3) reliance on a clear distinction between structures of the sociotechnical energy system and socioeconomic mechanisms to develop it and (4) ability to evaluate pathways along societal criteria. To that end we propose the development of a versatile multi-purpose integrated modeling framework, building on the specific strengths of the various modeling approaches available while at the same time omitting their weaknesses. This paper identifies respective strengths and weaknesses to guide such development.},

Additionally, improving air quality may benefit from or influence climate change mitigation. In a comparative scenario analysis, interactions between decarbonization targets and air pollution control as well as their implications on the European energy system are studied. For this purpose, the European energy system model TIMES PanEU is linked with the impact assessment model EcoSense to internalize the health costs related to air pollution. Results indicate that ambitious GHG reduction targets are most influential with respect to system transformations. Internalizing health impacts leads to welfare savings by reducing air pollution while still achieving the given reduction targets with lower utilization of carbon capture and storage as well as biomass. Especially the latter may partially be contradictory to targets on the share of renewable energy sources. Hence, integrated policies tackling climate change and air pollution alike may foster the transition to a low-carbon society. To gain a better understanding of the interplay between reduction targets, the share of renewable energy sources, and air pollution control, further research studying sector- and country-specific impacts in more detail is still needed.},

Could the target of the 2000 W society, i.e. a primary energy per capita (PEC) consumption of 2000 W, be realized until 2050? Various combinations of PEC and CO2 targets are tested, and the additional costs to be paid by the society are estimated. The assessment is carried out with the Swiss MARKAL model, a bottom-up energy-system model projecting future technology investments for Switzerland. The analysis reveals that the 2000 W society should be seen as a long-term goal. For all contemplated scenarios, a PEC consumption of 3500 W per capita (w/cap) is feasible in the year 2050. However, strong PEC consumption targets can reduce CO2 emissions to an equivalent of 5% per decade at maximum. For stronger CO2 emission reduction goals, corresponding targets must be formulated explicitly. At an oil price of 75 US$2000/bbl in 2050, the additional (cumulative, discounted) costs to reach a 10% CO2 reduction per decade combined with a 3500 W per capita target amount to about 40 billion US$2000. On the contrary, to reach pure CO2 reduction targets is drastically cheaper, challenging the vision of the 2000 W society. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We analyzed their importance in French industry with respect to their energy intensity, energy costs, value added, labour and the diffusion of production sites by using data at the 3-digit level with 236 sectors. Using a new decomposition method that gives no residual, this paper attempted to examine, over 10 years from 1996 to 2005, the changes that occurred in an area that has been neglected in energy analysis. We found that structural change had an overwhelming effect on the decline of aggregate energy intensity. Furthermore, we found that the higher the level of sector disaggregation, the more significant the changes that can be attributed to structural change, due to the homogeneity of this industrial group. The results of our study show that it is important to take into account the effects of structural change in "bottom-up" modelling exercises so as to improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasting for policy-makers and scientists.},

Our model determines the differentiated cost for energy savings in response to incentive policies under the ESC mechanism at a 4-digit level of NACE classification. Sensitivity analyses also show how gas prices and electricity carbon footprints impact on HP penetration.

To achieve this goal, we have developed the first detailed bottom-up energy model for Non-Energy Intensive industry (NEI) to study its global energy efficiency and the potential for CO2 emissions reduction at a 4-digit level of NACE classification. The latter, which is generally neglected in energy analyses, is expected to play an important role in reducing industry energy intensity in the long term due to its economic and energy significance and relatively high growth rate. In this paper, the modelling of NEI is done by energy end-use owing to the unsuitability of the end-product/process approach used in the Energy Intensive industry modelling. As an example, we analysed the impact of heat recovery with heat pumps (HP) on industrial processes up to 2020 on energy savings and CO2 emissions reductions in the French food & drink industry (F&D), the biggest NEI sector. The results showed HP could be an excellent and very promising energy recovery technology. For further detailed analysis, the depiction of HP investment cost payments is given per temperature range for each F&D subsector.

As a key component in the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries and nickel metal hydride batteries used in electric or hybrid vehicles, cobalt is expected to face a dynamic demand in the coming decades. Numerous questions are arising regarding the criticality risks of this key metal of the energy transition. In order to assess the availability of cobalt until 2050, we rely on our linear programming world energy-transport model, TIAM-IFPEN. Two climate scenarios were considered (2 °C and 4 °C), each with two different mobility scenarios (Business-as-Usual mobility and Sustainable mobility) and for each mobility scenario, three lithium-ion battery chemistry mix trajectories were considered (high, central and low cobalt content) by 2050. Results show that in the most stringent scenario 83,2% of cobalt resources identified in 2013 would be extracted from the ground by 2050 to satisfy global consumption. Two Thirds of world production is from Africa while China consumes 1/3 of the total demand by 2050. We identify several ways to meet the increasing demand for cobalt resources. Public policies must therefore focus on 3 complementary axes: promoting the development of sustainable mobility; prioritizing low cobalt content batteries in electric vehicles; and concentrating efforts on the implementation and the deployment of a system for recovering, sorting and recycling waste.},

abstract = {The paper aims to address the potential of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen in decarbonizing the European energy system; specifically, reducing emissions by 55% in 2030 compared to 1990, and targeting net-zero emissions by 2050. The methodology relies on a cost-optimization modelling approach using three models complementarily: a detailed European TIMES-type model (MIRET-EU); an aggregated model for the European energy system, allowing endogenous cost reductions based on technology deployment in a dynamic programming formulation for investment strategies (Integrate Europe); and a dedicated model for assessing hydrogen import options for Europe (HyPE). Two policy-relevant scenarios have been developed: Technology Diversification (TD) and Renewable Push (RP). Both lead to climate neutrality in Europe in 2050 but the RP scenario differs by setting new reinforced targets for renewable technologies in Europe. Results show that hydrogen production would increase sharply in the coming decades, exceeding 30 million tons (Mt) by 2030 and more than 100 Mt by 2050 in both scenarios. Polyvalence of hydrogen in decarbonizing the European energy system for certain hard-to-abate energy uses in transport and industry is also observed. European hydrogen production relies on a diverse mix including both renewable and low-carbon technologies. It is complemented by hydrogen imports from neighboring regions, that represent between 10 and 15% of total demand in 2050. Access to existing cross-border pipelines is a critical advantage compared to maritime transport. Notably, there are considerable cost reductions due to technology deployment for solar power and hydrogen production by electrolyzers.},

It is the first time that the integration of system adequacy and transient stability has been achieved in prospective studies for an electro intensive country, following studies conducted on Reunion Island. The methodology relies on a quantitative assessment of the French power sector's reliability through an endogenous definition of a reliability indicator related to kinetic reserves into an Energy System Optimization Model (ESOM), TIMES-FR model. The result gives an overview of how the stability of the grid is maintained with an increasing share of renewables using additional back-up and flexible options. We observe that it is technically possible to achieve around 65% of Variable Renewable Energy sources (VREs) in the installed capacity without impairing the reliability of the system. In more detail, the maximum VRE in total hourly power production that complies with the reliability constraint was assessed as around 84% in the 100 EnR scenario. However, in order to guarantee this system reliability, the cumulated new installed capacity, in a scenario with 100% renewable energy sources (RES) in the power mix, would represent the double of the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario over the period 2013–2050. Therefore, major upstream planning would be needed, and that more flexible options i.e. demand-response, storage technologies and interconnections or substitute or additional plants should be considered to satisfy the reliability constraint at any time by providing extra inertia to the system. This modelling exercise shows the importance of power exchanges with neighbours with higher share of RE in the power production.},

This paper presents a comparative study between EMINENT and other tools for energy technology assessment. The tools analysed were CO2DB, MARKAL, IKARUS and E3Database. Although there are many different energy technology assessment tools, EMINENT seems to be the only one targeting EST. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper analyses which interactions provide valuable information for the energy system and how future water use projection could be conducted with the help of energy system modelling. It was assumed that different national climate policy scenarios for the energy system influence the water projections. The interactions considered for the German case study are: water demand for cooling technologies, irrigation practices of energy crops, as well as literature based assessments of total water demand and renewable water availability. Based on the energy scenario analysis, water use for the energy system will shift over time from cooling water use to irrigation water use for energy crops and the amount of irrigation water use is dependent on the demand of biomass which increases for stricter climate targets. There is a small risk of future water stress that can be eliminated through the use of recycled water for irrigation.},

The adoption of EVs depends on consumer preferences, including cost, social status and driving habits, although it is agreed that current and expected costs play a major role. We use a partial equilibrium model that minimizes total energy system costs to assess whether EVs can be a cost-effective option for the consumers of each EU27 member state up to 2050, focusing on the impact of different vehicle investment costs and CO2 mitigation targets. We found that for an EU-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction cap of 40% and 70% by 2050 vis-{\`{a}}-vis 1990 emissions, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are cost-effective in the EU only by 2030 and only if their costs are 30% lower than currently expected. At the EU level, vehicle costs and the capability to deliver both short- and long-distance mobility are the main drivers of BEV deployment. Other drivers include each state's national mobility patterns and the cost-effectiveness of alternative mitigation options, both in the transport sector, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) or biofuels, and in other sectors, such as renewable electricity.},

This paper presents a method that uses stochastic programming to represent variable renewable electricity generation in long-term energy system models, and demonstrates this on a Norwegian TIMES model. First, we derive hourly PV- and wind-generation data by modifying satellite-based data, based on a comparison with historical generation data. Second, the satellite-based dataset is transformed into a manageable set of scenarios that is used as an input to the stochastic energy-system model. This is done using six different scenario generation methods. Third, we solve the energy-system model with three of the scenario-generation methods and evaluate the quality of the corresponding model value by stability tests. We demonstrate that scenarios generated from the six methods have significantly different moment-based and Wasserstein distance error relative to the dataset. Further, the energy system model results show that the number of scenarios needed to achieve stability differs between the three used scenario generation methods.},

Analyses are done by a stochastic TIMES model with an explicit representation of the short-term uncertainty related to electricity supply and heat demand in buildings. We define a nearly ZEB to be a highly efficient building with on-site PV production. To evaluate the flexibility requirement of the surrounding energy system, we consider no use of energy storage within the ZEBs. The results show that ZEBs reduce the investments in non-flexible hydropower, wind power and Combined Heat and Power, and increase the use of direct electric heating and electric boilers. With building integrated PV production of 53 TWh in 2050, ZEBs increase the Scandinavian electricity generation by 16 TWh and increase the net electricity export by 19 TWh. Although the increased production reduces the electricity prices, the low heat demand in ZEBs gives a drop in the electricity consumption by 4 TWh in 2050. Finally, the results demonstrate that the Scandinavian energy system is capable of integrating a large amount of ZEBs with intermittent PV production due to the flexible hydropower in Norway and Sweden.},

abstract = {The overall objective of this work is to identify the effects of climate change on the Norwegian energy system towards 2050. Changes in the future wind- and hydro-power resource potential, and changes in the heating and cooling demand are analysed to map the effects of climate change. The impact of climate change is evaluated with an energy system model, the MARKAL Norway model, to analyse the future cost optimal energy system. Ten climate experiments, based on five different global models and six emission scenarios, are used to cover the range of possible future climate scenarios and of these three experiments are used for detailed analyses. This study indicate that in Norway, climate change will reduce the heating demand, increase the cooling demand, have a limited impact on the wind power potential, and increase the hydro-power potential. The reduction of heating demand will be significantly higher than the increase of cooling demand, and thus the possible total direct consequence of climate change will be reduced energy system costs and lower electricity production costs. The investments in offshore wind and tidal power will be reduced and electric based vehicles will be profitable earlier. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel bidirectional linkage between a long-term energy system model and an operational power market model. This combined modelling framework provides long-term energy system investment strategies that explicitly consider the operational complexity of the power sector. The linkage is demonstrated using an energy system model of Norway and a European power market model with a specific high detail level of hydropower operation. For Norway, with its hydropower-dominated electricity sector, the linkage is designed to improve the modelling of hydropower generation and external electricity markets in the energy system model, and to provide consistent assumptions concerning Norwegian electricity demand and capacity in the power market model. The difference in income of hydropower producers, which is endogenous in both models, is used as a convergence criterion. The linkage is tested for various future developments of the European power market and is successful for three of the four analysed instances. However, when the linkage is evaluated in a system with a very high share of intermittent electricity generation and large variations in electricity price, it fails to converge on hydropower income. This is because the simulated Norwegian electricity prices differ significantly between the two models in this situation.},

abstract = {This paper uses confidence intervals from sample average approximation (SAA) and stability tests to evaluate the quality of the solution of a long-term energy system model with stochastic wind power production. Using poorly designed scenarios can give stochastic model results that depend on the scenario representation rather than the actual underlying uncertainty. Nevertheless, there is little focus on the quality of the solutions of stochastic energy models in the applied literature. Our results demonstrate how too small a sample size can give a poor energy system design and misrepresent the value of the stochastic solution (VSS). We demonstrate how to evaluate the number of scenarios needed to ensure in-sample and out-of-sample stability. We also show how replication and testing of many candidate solutions using SAA iterations can provide a solution with a satisfactory confidence interval, including when the samples contain fewer scenarios than required for stability. An important observation, though, is that if SAA repeatedly solves the model with a sample size that satisfies in-sample and out-of-sample stability, the confidence interval is narrow, and the solutions are of high quality in terms of providing a tight bound for the optimal solution.},

In this paper the intermittent characteristics of wind power are modelled as a stochastic parameter in a long-term TIMES model of the Danish heat and electricity sector. To our knowledge, this is not a common approach in long-term investment models, and has not been done previously in TIMES, where the short-term uncertainty of wind power is normally taken into account by a deterministic constraint that ensures excess back-up capacity. In our model, the stochasticity gives lower total energy system costs, significant lower investments in wind power, less expected electricity export and higher expected biomass consumption compared to using the traditional deterministic approach. Also, the deterministic investment strategy can be insufficient in periods with poor wind conditions. Based on our findings, we recommend using a stochastic representation of intermittent renewables in long-term investment models to provide more solid results for decision makers.},

This study apply a stochastic TIMES model that considers the short-term uncertainty in electricity supply and value the flexibility of hydro reservoirs. It is the first time this approach is used to quantify the effects of these policy actions on cost-optimal investments and operations. To consider the uncertainty of the energy market, we analyse the policy actions under four different price developments for biomass, fossil fuels and electricity. The results demonstrate that our stochastic approach provides different model decisions compared to the traditional deterministic approach. Further, we show that the future role of the large hydro reservoirs in Norway and Sweden depends both on the adopted policy actions and on future energy prices, and that the policy actions have a significant impact on the development of the energy system. This insight is valuable when considering the development and management of the hydro reservoirs. It is also valuable for other European countries so that they can evaluate the interplay of the hydro reservoirs with other energy storage options.},

To limit its heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels, Reunion Island aims to achieve energy autonomy by 2030 based on greater energy efficiency and renewable energy alternatives. The objective of this study is to analyze different scenarios to reach electricity autonomy and, at the same time, consider the wide-scale integration of renewable energy in the island's power system using the bottom-up optimization energy model TIMES-Reunion. Despite the tremendous potential of renewable energy sources present on the island, the transition to 100% renewable energy needs to be supported by incentives or constraints. Strong energy policies can both direct the choice of renewable resources and accelerate the renewable transition. The development of biomass on Reunion Island is economically interesting. The transition scenarios show that by 2030, electricity from biomass advantageously replaces electricity from coal and represents slightly more than 50% of electricity generation. Solar and wave/ocean energies are not the most cost effective option, but wind energy tends to disappear in the face of these energies more politically supported. A network regulation rule benefits biomass and is more detrimental to solar than to wave energy. The decarbonized transition of the power system incurs higher total discounted system costs due to the additional costs induced by the different incentives to promote certain renewables, with some pathways toward energy autonomy appearing more costly than others.},

abstract = {The challenges of climate change involve totally rethinking the world's energy system. In particular, CCS technologies are still presented as a solution to reach ambitious climate targets. However, avoiding the required Gt of CO2 emissions by investing in CCS technologies supposes the development of carbon storage capacities. This analysis, conducted with TIAM-FR and based on a wide review of geological storage potential and various data, aims to discuss the impact of this potential on the development of the CCS option. We also specify a scenario allowing the exclusion of onshore storage due to a hypothetic policy considering public resistance to onshore storage, and carbon transport costs variation effects. The implementation of CCS is less impacted by the level of carbon storage potential - except in the lowest case of availability - than by the type of sequestration site. However, the development of CCS is lower at the end of the period in the case of a decrease in carbon storage potential. Indeed, the question of type of storage site appears to have a greater impact, with an arbitrage between deep saline aquifers and depleted basins and enhanced recovery. Doubling the cost of carbon transport does not limit the penetration of carbon capture technologies, but it does impact the choice of site. Finally, a limitation of onshore storage could have a significant impact on the penetration of the CCS option. The explanation for this limited deployment of CCS is thus the higher cost of offshore storage more than the level of storage potential.},

Therefore, it may become necessary to use BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) technologiesto remove CO2 from the atmosphere. This technique is gaining increasing attention as it offers the dual benefit of providing low-carbon energy products and leading to negative CO2 emissions. This study evaluates the possible deployment of BECCS in the power sector using the bottom-up multiregional optimization model TIAM-FR (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model France). Under two climate scenarios, a regional analysis is conducted to discuss where the technology will be developed. The impact of the unavailability of this technology on the structure of the electricity mix and the cost of the energy system completes the analysis. In line with literature, the results suggest that BECCS technology offers an environmentally and economically viable option to achieve stringent targets. The regional analysis shows that industrialized countries will develop CCS (carbon capture and storage) mainly on biomass power plants while CCS on fossil fuel power plants will be widely deployed in China. With a specific constraint on CCS diffusion, the share of renewables and nuclear energy becomes significant to meet the climate targets.},

This study evaluates the impact of nuclear power reduction in Europe on the electricity mix under carbon emission reduction scenarios while considering the availability of carbon capture and storage technological options (CCS). The potential cost of carbon reduction is also addressed using the bottom-up optimization model TIAM-FR. The results suggest that CCS technologies constitute an interesting option in a case of stringent climate targets and limited nuclear electricity. However, the unavailability of CCS technologies induces a significant increase in carbon marginal cost and energy system cost to achieve the climate policy.},

abstract = {The China-UK Near Zero Emissions Coal (NZEC) Initiative examined options for carbon (CO2) capture, transport and geological storage in China. It was developed under the 2005 EU-China NZEC Agreement which aims to demonstrate CCS in China and the EU. Collaborative research activities were conducted jointly by Chinese and UK experts from 30 organisations. China's energy demand is expected to continue growing significantly; however the share of coal is projected to decrease to around 50% by 2050. For the power generation and energy intensive industrial sectors, all of which remain heavily dependent on coal, CCS is the only option that can ensure a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. A range of CO2 capture technologies in coal-fired power generation have been examined. The more promising, near term options are post-combustion capture using Monoethanolamine in a state of the art pulverised coal power plant and pre-combustion capture in an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle unit. The cost of electricity generation with capture would be 463 and 413 RMB per MWh respectively for these options. Less mature capture technology options offer some potential to lower the overall cost, but this is within the range of uncertainties. Storage assessments were undertaken in two basins in North East China. These have potential to make use of CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) although the reservoirs are geologically complex and well integrity may be a significant risk. While CO 2 EOR would provide the opportunity for gaining initial experience with CO2 injection and storage, the capacity available for EOR in these regions appears insufficient for large scale CCS. It would therefore be necessary to assess and ultimately use saline aquifers for storage. An extensive saline aquifer formation has been identified in the Songliao Basin through the project. The average cost of electricity generation taking account of capture, transport and storage costs (assuming a storage site 200km from the power plant) would be 470 RMB per MWh for the most mature capture options, an increase of around 200 RMB per MWh compared with a Pulverised Coal reference plant without CCS. This is equivalent to a cost of avoided emissions of about 280 RMB (US $50.0) per tonne of CO2. There are several challenges that need to be addressed for CCS in China. These include the extra cost and energy penalty of CCS, the novelty of the technology, the lack of regulations governing the storage of CO2 underground and the availability of the necessary equipment for deployment of CCS in China. The China-UK NZEC Initiative has shown that CCS could provide a key, low carbon option for coal-based industry in China, particularly for power generation, which would enable the continued use of coal with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. An Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the European Commission and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology for Phase II of the China-EU NZEC Agreement in November 2009. Phase II will involve the selection of a demonstration project and the completion of a feasibility study. Phase III will involve the construction and operation of a CCS demonstration project in China. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The steel industry is the world's largest industrial source of CO2 emissions. Recent UK economic policies have led to reduced domestic steel production giving an apparent reduction in national emissions. However, demand for goods made from steel has not reduced. Emissions have thus been transferred not reduced and implementation of UK climate policies may in future expand this 'carbon leakage.' This paper explores how future UK demand for goods made from steel might be supplied while satisfying national climate policies, and how this will influence global CO2 emissions. Current flows and stocks of steel are estimated from existing databases. Evidence from other developed economies suggests that per capita stocks are tending towards a saturation level so future demand is forecast from population growth and the expected rate of replacement of a stable stock. The carbon intensities of five different steel-making routes are used to predict the allowed scale of future domestic steel production within the industrial emissions allowances set in four energy pathways defined by the UK Government. The remaining requirement for steel must be sourced offshore and the associated emissions are predicted, to give an estimate of the global emissions arising from final demand in the UK. The results show that current UK climate strategy may have a limited effect in reducing the CO2 emissions of the global steel industry, unless the UK shifts towards producing more of its own steel products with domestic secondary steel-making. This option would also increase the security of UK supply and support an expansion of UK manufacturing.},

In this paper, the JRC-EU-TIMES model - a bottom-up, technology-rich model of the EU28 energy system - is used to assess the role of hydrogen in a future decarbonised Europe under two climate scenarios, current policy initiative (CPI) and long-term decarbonisation (CAP). Our results indicate that hydrogen could become a viable option already in 2030 - however, a long-term CO2 cap is needed to sustain the transition. In the CAP scenario, the share of hydrogen in the final energy consumption of the transport and industry sectors reaches 5% and 6% by 2050. Low-carbon hydrogen production technologies dominate, and electrolysers provide flexibility by absorbing electricity at times of high availability of intermittent sources. Hydrogen could also play a significant role in the industrial and transport sectors, while the emergence of stationary hydrogen fuel cells for hydrogen-to-power would require significant cost improvements, over and above those projected by the experts.},

abstract = {CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is not currently a priority for the Government of India (GOI) because, whilst a signatory to the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, there are no existing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and most commentators do not envisage compulsory targets for India in the post-2012 phase. The overwhelming priority for the GOI is to sustain a high level of economic growth (8%+) and provision of secure, reliable energy (especially electricity) is one of the widely recognised bottlenecks in maintaining a high growth rate. In such a supply-starved context, it is not easy to envisage adoption of CCS-which increases overall generation capacity and demand for coal without increasing actual electricity supply-as being acceptable. Anything which increases costs-even slightly-is very unlikely to happen, unless it is fully paid for by the international community. The majority viewpoint of the industry and GOI interviewees towards CCS appears to be that it is a frontier technology, which needs to be developed further in the Annex-1 countries to bring down the cost through RD&D and deployment. More RD&D is required to assess in further detail the potential for CO2 storage in geological reservoirs in India and the international community has an important role to play in cultivating such research. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

The present study shows that if the share of electricity based transport services is to grow from 10% in 2015 to 35% by 2050, the hydropower generation capacity would have to increase by 495MW by 2050 as compared to the base case, while the annual electricity generation in 2050 would have to increase by 7.86TWh. As a result, the cumulative total imported energy would decrease by 14.6% in the 35% transport electrification scenario as compared to the base case during 2015-2050.

The modelling results indicate that building energy consumption is expected to grow to around 41.6EJ in the reference scenario in 2050. The energy saving potential in 2050 can be up to 4EJ due to the improvement of both building insulation (envelop) and energy use technologies.

It takes into account a range of criteria to reflect relevant environmental, social and economic considerations, capture the value of diversity, and reflect innovative potential and learning capacity. The combination of these factors allows for solutions in which there is more balance between economic, environmental and social dimensions, unlike in previous studies. Scenarios that might have been preferred on the basis of, for example, minimal costs or low CO2 emissions, will have to be reconsidered because of negative effects in terms of land use or unemployment. The decision making philosophy in this case changes from that of optimization to multi-criteria satisficing. This article argues for consideration of the following dimensions of the energy system: costs, emissions, water use, land use and employment. Consideration of such dimensions will shift energy system into the direction of overall sustainability while making it more resilient in the long-term. The approach is applied to the case of the United Kingdom by making use of a MARKAL model, complementing its goal of cost-minimization with additional, social and environmental criteria.

The study considers three cases of CO2 emission reduction targets and analyzes their benefits during the study period as compared to the reference scenario.

The third case considers a 40% cutback of CO2 emission with the share of electric mass transport (EMT) in the land transport service demand increased to 30% (as compared to 20% in the reference scenario). The study shows that an implementation of Scenario ERT40 would increase the cumulative electricity generation (mainly from hydropower) by 16.5% (794 TWh), reduce the cumulative consumption of imported fuels by 42% (24,400 PJ) and increase the total energy system cost by 1.6% during 2005 to 2100 as compared to the reference scenario. Besides, there would be a reduction in the emission of local pollutants and generation of additional employment in the country.

This paper tries to understand gas demand in future from electricity sector. This paper models the future demand for gas in India from the electricity sector under alternative scenarios for the period 2005-2025, using bottom-up ANSWER MARKAL model. The scenarios are differentiated by alternate economic growth projections and policies related to coal reforms, infrastructure choices and local environment. The results across scenarios show that gas competes with coal as a base-load option if price difference is below US $ 4 per MBtu. At higher price difference gas penetrates only the peak power market. Gas demand is lower in the high economic growth scenario, since electricity sector is more flexible in substitution of primary energy.

abstract = {We study how changes in cross-border energy infrastructure in North America will impact local and national markets. Electricity and natural gas are all transported across the borders of Canada, US, and Mexico. However, future changes in the energy production mix will lead to the further development of these infrastructures, as energy supply and demand cause stress across borders. We use a multimodel approach to investigate what happens to standard output metrics of local energy markets when these infrastructures are changed under different scenarios. These scenarios include increasing the capacity of electricity transmission by 20% and decreasing the cost of transporting natural gas by 20% vis-{\`{a}}-vis the modelers' reference case starting 2020. We find that electricity transmission across the Canadian-US border increases, with most of the increase in electricity production by natural gas. We also find that natural gas trade increases across the US-Mexico border, with a change in flows of natural gas within the US moving away from the northeast and northwest. While electricity production from renewable energy is expected to increase in the reference scenario, the changes in cross-border energy infrastructure do not significantly impact the generation from renewable energy. The scenarios help identify bottlenecks in the cross-border energy infrastructure, and propose future investment opportunities to decrease overall system costs for producing and consuming energy.},

In this paper we present results for the whole of the European power sector regarding on how considering current and future climate variability affects the results of a TIMES energy system model for the whole European power sector (eTIMES-EU) up to 2050. For each member-state we consider six climate projections to generate future capacity factors for wind, solar and hydro power generation. as well as temperature impact on electricity demand for heating and cooling. These are input into the eTIMES-EU model to assess how climate affects the optimal operation of the power system and if current EU-wide RES and emissions target deployment may be affected.

abstract = {This paper quantifies the contribution of Portuguese energy policies for total and marginal abatement costs (MAC) for CO2 emissions for 2020. The TIMES_PT optimisation model was used to derive MAC curves from a set of policy scenarios including one or more of the following policies: ban on nuclear power; ban on new coal power plants without carbon sequestration and storage; incentives to natural gas power plants; and a cap on biomass use. The different MAC shows the policies' effects in the potential for CO2 abatement. In 2020, in the most encompassing policy scenario, with all current and planned policies, is possible to abate only up to +35% of 1990 emissions at a cost below 23 € t/CO2. In the more flexible policy scenarios, it is possible to abate up to -10% of 1990 emissions below the same cost. The total energy system costs are 10-13% higher if all policies are implemented-76 to 101 B€-roughly the equivalent to 2.01-2.65% of the 2005 GDP. Thus, from a CO2 emission mitigation perspective, the existing policies introduce significant inefficiencies, possibly related to other policy goals. The ban on nuclear power is the instrument that has the most significant effect in MAC. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In a world where an increasing share of the population lives in cities, its energy transition is gaining more relevance. The decision-making process in urban planning is frequently fragmented across departments considering different criteria. Integrated city planning approaches are not commonly employed, especially for the promotion of sustainable energy. This paper presents an innovative approach to promote holistic decision-support combining complex integrated city energy system models (ESM) with effective stakeholder input using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). A holistic optimization city-ESM, based on the TIMES model generator, was developed and implemented in four European cities ({\'{E}}vora in Portugal, Cesena in Italy, Nottingham in UK and Trikala in Greece). Each city defined a range of future scenarios for sustainable energy promotion up to 2030 which were modelled in the city-ESM. The scenarios considered both individual measures, such as expansion of bicycle lanes, and combinations of measures. Going one step further from typical approaches in urban energy modelling, the modelling work was carried out in close cooperation with city stakeholders whom participated not only in the definition of the modelled scenarios, but also on the critical review of the modelling results. This review was conducted through a MCDA exercise which considered both quantitative and qualitative criteria in the selection of candidate scenarios to be implemented. It was found that there are substantial differences in most desirable scenarios if the MCDA is performed as well or if only the city-ESM model results are considered. The critical review of quantitative modelling results and their ranking via the MCDA led to improved communication of model results to non-modellers, which in turn made possible a better scrutiny and improvement of the modelling. It is concluded that at an urban level is important to combine qualitative analysis with quantitative modelling to identify the optimum mix of measures for a sustainable urban energy future.},

This makes the case for energy system modelling at city level, as done within the INSMART EU project, which identified the optimum mix of measures for a sustainable energy future for four European cities in a holistic manner. The approach combined quantitative modelling with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. Sector specific data and models (buildings and transport) were articulated into one integrated energy system model based on the TIMES model generator. It was found that urban level energy modelling brings with it a new set of challenges, since for a well-known territory, transparency and effective communication with local decision-makers are even more important than at national or transnational level. Special efforts should be paid to making model results geographically explicit, and urban modelling results should expect scrutiny by local agents. It was found that there is a gap between the scope for action of local energy planners and the most energy intensive urban sectors, which highlighted new priorities instead of those traditionally taken under municipal management.},

abstract = {Energy-economy-environment models are fundamental in developing realistic cost-effective climate policy. However, such models by necessity are simplified based on assumptions which co-determine the outcomes of scenario modelling. Major assumptions relate to demographic and economic development, technology evolution and deployment and policy decisions. The core of this analysis is to quantify how specific assumptions influence the outcomes of scenarios; not taking them together as usually in the literature but instead looking into them apiece. The TIMES modelling framework is broadly used for climate policy support and here we used the Portuguese version as an example. As the structure of TIMES modelling is similar in other countries and also for larger aggregates as the EU and the World, the method can be applied there quite directly, although outcomes will differ between countries due to differences in energy technologies and energy markets. The outcomes for the Portugal Baseline scenario using TIMES_PT show the relevance of this exercise in this sensitivity analysis on assumptions. Contrary to what might be expected, varying assumptions on the availability and price of energy resources lead to minor variations on GHG emissions in the modelling outcomes, less than 2% of the Baseline scenario emissions in 2020. The more relevant assumptions to overall uncertainty are related to socio-economic development, followed by assumptions on technology deployment. This detailed uncertainty analysis on assumptions helps to assess the robustness of modelling outcomes in the TIMES model framework, next to other aspects like model structure and validity.},

A “reference” and seven decarbonised scenarios are modelled for EU28. We conclude on the importance of policy decisions for the configuration of the low carbon power sector, especially on nuclear acceptance and available sites for new RES plants. Differently from typical analysis focussing on technology portfolio for each route, we analyse the deployment of each technology across policy routes, for optimising technology R&D. R&D priority should be given to those less-policy-sensitive technologies that are in any case deployed rapidly across the modelled time horizon (e.g. PV), but also to those deployed up to their technical potentials and typically less sensitive to exogenous policy routes. For these ‘no regret' technologies (e.g. geothermal), R&D efforts should focus on increasing their technical potential. For possibly cost-effective technologies very sensitive to the policy routes (e.g. CSP and marine), R&D efforts should be directed to improving their techno-economic performance.},

This paper aims to assess the contribution of RES for the CC mitigation in Portugal until 2050, under cost-effectiveness criteria. The TIMES_PT linear optimization bottom-up technology model was used to generate six scenarios to 2050 combining GHG emission caps, levels of socio-economic growth and share of RES electricity. In order to meet the 2050 energy demand, the share of RES in primary energy consumption increases 4 to 6 times from 2005 and in final energy grows from 15% in 2005 to 56-59% in 2050. RES were found to be cost-effective even without a GHG cap. Regarding CC mitigation the high RES shares in final energy correspond to less 49-74% GHG emissions in 2050 compared to a baseline without cap. The role of renewable electricity is determinant to mitigate CC especially due to hydro and onshore wind. Other important deployments of RES technologies are solar water heating and heat pumps in buildings, biomass use for process heat in industry and biodiesel in transport. Keywords:},

However, the generation potential and integration costs of variable renewable energy sources and their time profile of production depend on geographic characteristics and infrastructure in place. For a case study for Austria we generate spatially highly resolved synthetic time series for potential production locations of wind power and PV. There are regional differences in the costs for wind turbines but not for PV. However, they are smaller than the cost reductions induced by technological learning from one modelled decade to the other. The wind availability shows significant regional differences where mainly the differences for summer days and winter nights are important. The solar availability for PV installations is more homogenous. We introduce these wind and PV data into the energy system model JRC-EU-TIMES with different levels of regional disaggregation. Results show that up to the point that the maximum potential is reached disaggregating wind regions significantly affects results causing lower electricity generation from wind and PV.},

Calculated marginal-costs, obtained with the three methods, turn out to be similar. The calculated marginal-costs are also compared to the actual heat tariff in use by the utility. Using prices based on marginal costs should be able to bring about an efficient resource-allocation.

abstract = {Geological carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is currently seriously considered for addressing, in the near term, the problem of climate change. CCS technology is available today and is expected to become an increasingly affordable CO2 abatement alternative. Whereas the rapidly growing scientific literature on CCS as well as experimental and commercial practice demonstrate the technological and economic feasibility of implementing this clean fossil fuel option on a large scale, relatively little attention has been paid so far to the risks and environmental externalities of geological storage of CO2. This paper assesses the effects of including CCS damage costs in a long-term energy scenario analysis for Europe. An external cost sensitivity analysis is performed with a bottom-up energy technology model that accounts not only for CCS technologies but also for their external costs. Our main conclusion is that in a business-as-usual scenario (i.e. without climate change intervention or externality internalisation), CCS technologies are likely to be deployed at least to some extent, mainly in the power generation sector, given the economic benefits of opportunities such as enhanced coal bed methane, oil and gas recovery. Under a strict climate (CO2 emissions) constraint, CCS technologies are deployed massively. With the simultaneous introduction of both CO2 and CCS taxation in the power sector, designed to internalise the external atmospheric and geological effects of CO2 emissions and storage, respectively, we find that CCS will only be developed if the climate change damage costs are at least of the order of 100 €/t CO2 or the CO2 storage damage costs not more than a few €/t CO2. When the internalised climate change damage costs are as high as 67 €/t CO2, the expensive application of CCS to biomass-fuelled power plants (with negative net CO2 emissions) proves the most effective CCS alternative to reduce CO2 emissions, rather than CCS applied to fossil-based power plants. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is a growing scientific consensus that limiting the increase in global average temperature to around 2 °C above pre-industrial levels is necessary to avoid unacceptable impact on the climate system. This requires that the developed countries' emissions are radically reduced during the next 40 years. Energy scenario studies provide insights on the societal transitions that might be implied by such low-carbon futures, and in this paper we discuss how a greater attention to different governance and institutional issues can complement future scenario exercises. The analysis is based on a critical review of 20 quantitative and qualitative scenario studies, all of relevance for meeting long-term climate policy objectives. The paper: (a) analyzes some key differences in energy technology mixes and primary energy use patterns across these studies; (b) briefly explores the extent and the nature of the societal challenges and policy responses implied; and (c) discusses a number of important implications for the design and scope of future scenario studies. Our review shows that in previous scenario studies the main attention is typically paid to analyzing the impact of well-defined and uniform policy instruments, while fewer studies factor in the role of institutional change in achieving different energy futures. We therefore point towards a number of strategies of integrating issues of transition governance into future scenario analyses, and argue for a closer synthesis of qualitative and quantitative scenario building. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: To this end, it uses the TIMES-EU energy-economic model and assesses the impact of key policy options and targets in the area of CO<DN>2</DN> emissions reduction, renewable energies and energy efficiency improvements. The results are also compared with the cogeneration potentials as reported by the Member States in their national reports. Findings: The paper shows that CHP output could be more than doubled and that important CHP penetration potential exists in expanding the European district heating systems. This result is even more pronounced with the far-reaching CO<DN>2</DN> emissions reduction necessary in order to meet a long-term 2 degree target. Nevertheless, the paper also shows that strong CO<DN>2</DN> emission reductions in the energy sector might limit the CHP potential due to increased competition for biomass with the transport sector. Originality/value: Given the proven socio-economic benefits of using CHP, the paper identifies the areas for future research in order to better exploit the potential of this technology such as the combination of CHP and district cooling or country- and industry-specific options to generate process heat. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Baselines are generally accepted as a key input assumption in long-term energy modelling, but energy models have traditionally been poor on identifying baselines assumptions. Notably, transparency on the current policy content of model baselines is now especially critical as long-term climate mitigation policies have been underway for a number of years. This paper argues that the range of existing energy and emissions policies are an integral part of any long-term baseline, and hence already represent a "with-policy" baseline, termed here a Business-as-Unusual (BAuU). Crucially, existing energy policies are not a sunk effort; as impacts of existing policy initiatives are targeted at future years, they may be revised through iterative policy making, and their quantitative effectiveness requires ex-post verification. To assess the long-term role of existing policies in energy modelling, currently identified UK policies are explicitly stripped out of the UK MARKAL Elastic Demand (MED) optimisation energy system model, to generate a BAuU (with-policy) and a REF (without policy) baseline. In terms of long-term mitigation costs, policy-baseline assumptions are comparable to another key exogenous modelling assumption - that of global fossil fuel prices. Therefore, best practice in energy modelling would be to have both a no-policy reference baseline, and a current policy reference baseline (BAuU). At a minimum, energy modelling studies should have a transparent assessment of the current policy contained within the baseline. Clearly identifying and comparing policy-baseline assumptions are required for cost effective and objective policy making, otherwise energy models will underestimate the true cost of long-term emissions reductions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper compares the potentially key role of CCS within cost-optimizing energy systems modelling at the national level (ensuring country-specific technical, economic and policy detail), and the regional level (ensuring transboundary electricity and CO2 trade). Analysis at alternate model scales investigates the full range of drivers on the feasibility and trade-offs in using the Utsira formation as a common North Sea CO2 storage resource. A robust finding is that low carbon electricity is a primary decarbonisation pathway and that CCS plays a key role (32-40%) within this portfolio. This paper confirms that the overall driver of the amount of CCS utilized is the climate policy, with by 2050 a total of 475-570MtCO2 captured and stored (of which 110-120MtCO2 is stored in Utsira) under an 80% CO2 reduction target. Modelled country differences are much larger due to specific national policies and to regional (EU) commodity trading. From 2030 onwards, Utsira plays a key role within the CO2 storage cost curve, with the Netherlands and the UK being the largest contributors, followed by transboundary flows of CO2 from other countries. However, overall regional CCS flows may be larger (for example under low fossil fuel prices) than the estimated (and uncertain) maximum annual injection rates into Utsira which could potentially represent a significant constraint. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A multi-year model construction process of the UK MARKAL-Macro-hybrid energy-economic model, and four subsequent major policy analyses illustrates the scope of this interaction. The initial set of modelling runs focused on the technical feasibility of long-term 60% carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction scenarios, the role of key technologies, and the underlying uncertainties. Furthermore subsequent modelling studies were aimed to generate insights on more stringent targets, and on issues and uncertainties that may make targets harder to achieve. Hence, this paper analyses the large number of long-term UK CO2 reduction scenarios through a clustering approach on target stringency and barriers to implementation. Robust findings and key uncertainties are highlighted, including the critical role of the power sector, trade-offs between resources, sectors, key energy technologies and behavioural responses, and the increasing level and spread of CO2 marginal prices and GDP impacts. The relevance and use of modelling insights to the UK energy policy process is shown in the continuation of the energy modelling-policy interface.

One of the key policy issues in Japan's energy and environmental policy arena is the energy system transition to achieve 80% emissions reduction in 2050, a current policy goal set in 2016. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate, this paper focuses on energy-related CO2 emissions and analyzes such decarbonization scenarios that are consistent with the government goals. We employ six energy-economic and integrated assessment models to reveal decarbonization challenges in the energy system. The modeling results show that Japan's mitigation scenarios are characterized by high marginal costs of abatement. They also suggest that the industrial sector is likely to have a large final energy share and significant residual emissions under the 80% reduction scenario, though it is generally thought that the transport sector would have large decarbonization challenges. The present findings imply that not only energy policy but also industrial policy may be relevant to the long-term environmental target. Given the high marginal costs exceeding those of negative emissions technologies that could place a cost ceiling, further model development would be crucial.},

While some studies have considered hydrogen as a power-to-power storage vector, it could also be used as a fuel across the energy system, for example for transport or heat generation. Here, two energy models are used to explore the potential contribution of P2G as a cost-effective source of hydrogen, particularly for future energy systems with high variable renewable energy (VRE) in which there are occasional periods when electricity supply exceeds demand. A detailed electricity system model is iterated with a multi-vector energy system model using a soft-linking approach. This iterative approach addresses shortcomings in each model to better understand the optimal capacity of P2G and the potential economic capture rate of excess VRE. The modelling method is applied to Great Britain in 2050 as a case study. A substantial proportion of excess VRE in 2050 can be captured by P2G, and it is economically competitive compared with alternative sources. Moreover, the effectiveness and economic viability of P2G for reducing excess renewable is robust at even very high levels of renewable penetration.},

This paper explores power system transition under climate change impacts on hydro resources, as well as the impact of climate change on the cost of decarbonisation. An integrated energy systems assessment tool is used to investigate the impact of altered seasonal availability factors on the optimal energy investment pathways. The cost of decarbonisation is assessed under climate change impact on the hydro resources, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions on the total cost of decarbonisation. Results show that in the case of New Zealand, more hydro will be available in winter due to climate change, but less in summer, which is compensated for with increased solar capacity. Decarbonisation in New Zealand sees a major transformation in the transport sector, supported by a relatively moderate increase in overall demand in the electricity sector. While climate change impact on the hydro resource may reduce the total cost of decarbonisation in New Zealand, this cannot be generalised, as these impacts vary across countries and regions.},

abstract = {African countries are in a unique position to reap the socio-economic and environmental benefits of renewable resources as a means for meeting increasing energy demand in a sustainable way. A critical obstacle for the deployment of renewable energy technologies in Africa is the difficulty of attracting sufficient and affordable finance. This paper compares the impact of financial conditions on the cost of electricity generation across six renewable and three fossil-based technologies in 46 African countries. The results show large cost variations and highlight the extent to which renewables are disadvantaged by current financial practices. The energy-economy-environment model TIAM-ECN is used to show how lowering financing costs results in a much higher deployment of renewables. For example, solar PV could account for 10–15% of total electricity generation by 2050, even without explicit climate policy, thanks to financial de-risking programmes. The results demonstrate that changes in financing schemes could outweigh the impact of technology learning. This paper also demonstrates that, once ambitious climate policies are in place, reducing financing costs for renewables could be an efficient way to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Financial de-risking is thus a key ingredient for unlocking the renewable energy potential in Africa.},

Cost-effective global and regional mitigation scenarios of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and F-gases were calculated with alternative assumptions on emissions trading. In the mitigation scenarios, an 85% reduction in CO2 emissions is needed from the baseline, and very significant changes in the energy system towards emission-free sources take place during this century. The largest new technology groups are carbon-capture and storage (CCS), nuclear power, wind power, advanced bioenergy technologies and energy efficiency measures. CCS technologies contributed a 5.5-Pg CO2 annual emission reduction by 2050 and 12 Pg CO2 reduction by 2100. Also large-scale forestation measures were found cost-efficient. Forestation measures reached their maximum impact of 7.7 Pg CO2 annual emission reduction in 2080.

Three different cases are developed: 1) Base Case, which gives the optimal electricity production mix, taking into account country's development plans (without climate change); 2) Climate Change Damage Case, which introduces the climate changes by adjusting the heating and cooling degree days inputs, consistent with the existing national climate scenarios; and 3) Climate Change Adaptation Case, in which the optimal electricity generation mix is determined by allowing for endogenous capacity adjustments in the model.

abstract = {The German energy supply sector is becoming diverse and dispersed due to the variety of actors investing in energy generation technologies and spatially variable renewable resources, which bring about increased heterogeneity in the investment decisions of actors. Therefore, the effective utilization of renewable resources towards a cost-optimal achievement of the “Energy Transition” goals is becoming more complex. We argue that addressing these complexities requires a method, which, in addition to a fine technological and regional characterization, takes into account the heterogeneity of the investment decisions of actors while optimizing the total system. This paper describes methodological improvements via the well-known energy system optimization model generator called The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (i.e. TIMES), which enhances the representation of the actors' investment realities regarding wind and photovoltaic technologies applied to the case of the German supply sector. Firstly, the actors are disaggregated by their main economic features, including cost of capital, representing their different investment valuations and budget restrictions. Then, Germany is divided into four regions to reflect the spatially variable renewable resources and electricity demand affecting actors' optimal decisions. Lastly, the grid development costs and losses are considered, especially for power transmission across the regions. The newly developed TIMES Actors Model (TAM) incorporating these improvements is then tested to separately study the impact of CO2 taxes as a policy instrument and a national renewable quota as a target for the sector. The results showed that CO2 taxes and renewable targets affect the system quite differently, specifically regarding the optimal role that actors are expected to play within regions to meet the objectives of energy transitions at least system costs as well as regarding the power transmission between the regions. By means of these findings, actors can be targeted more properly by actor- and region-specific policy instruments demonstrating which actor should invest where and into which technology, so that the energy transition can take place more quickly and at lower system costs. A comparison of the improved versus original versions of the model reveals the potential contribution of improving the representation of actors that have been so far overlooked in the energy system modelling practice.},

abstract = {Energy/Economy/Environment/Engineering (E4) models have been rarely apt to represent human behaviour in transportation mode adoption. This paper contributes to the scientific literature by using an E4 model to analyse the long-term decarbonisation of the Danish transport sector. The study is carried out with TIMES-DK, the integrated energy system model of Denmark, which has been expanded in order to endogenously determine modal shares. The methodology extends the technology competition within the modes to competition across modes by aggregating the passenger modal travel demands into demand segments based on the distance range. Modal shift is based not only on the levelised costs of the modes, but also on speed and infrastructure requirement. Constraints derived from the National Travel Survey guarantee consistent travel habits and avoid unrealistic modal shifts. The comparison of model versions with and without modal shift identifies its positive contribution to the fulfilment of the Danish environmental targets. Four sensitivity analyses on the key variables of modal shift assess how their alternative realizations affect the decarbonisation of the transport sector and enable shifting away from car. The results indicate that less strict travel time budget (TTB) and increased speed of public bus lead to a more efficient decarbonisation by 2050.},

abstract = {This study presents MoCho-TIMES, an original methodology for incorporating modal choice into energy-economy-environment-engineering (E4) system models. MoCho-TIMES addresses the scarce ability of E4 models to realistically depict behaviour in transport and allows for modal shift towards transit and non-motorized modes as a new dimension for decarbonising the transportation sector. The novel methodology determines endogenous modal shares by incorporating variables related to the level-of-service (LoS) of modes and consumers' modal perception within the E4 modeling framework. Heterogeneity of transport users is introduced to differentiate modal perception and preferences across different consumer groups, while modal preferences are quantified via monetization of intangible costs. A support transport simulation model consistent with the geographical scope of the E4 model provides the data and mathematical expressions required to develop the approach. This study develops MoCho-TIMES in the standalone transportation sector of TIMES-DK, the integrated energy system model for Denmark. The model is tested for the Business as Usual scenario and for four alternative scenarios that imply diverse assumptions for the new attributes introduced. The results show that different assumptions for the new attributes affect modal shares and CO2 emissions. MoCho-TIMES inaugurates the possibility to perform innovative policy analyses involving new parameters to the E4 modeling framework. The results find that authority's commitment to sustainability is crucial for a paradigmatic change in the transportation sector.},

In the UK, MARKAL modelling has a long history helping underpin government energy and climate policy. We trace the use of the model from its initial development in the mid-1970s to the present day, highlighting attributes that contribute to its role as a successful 'boundary object' for different but interconnecting energy policy communities. We suggest that changing images of the energy policy problem have enabled MARKAL to shift from an initial role in identifying technologies to reduce oil dependency to playing a key role in target-oriented climate policy. Furthermore, we argue that the ability of MARKAL to perform different roles for different groups has served to embed and institutionalise the model in the energy policy community. Moreover, the capacity of the model to represent detailed technology options has accorded with a technological focus that has suited prevailing, shared conceptions of the energy-climate policy problem.},

abstract = {In this paper, the possibilities and conditions for CCS applications in Finland are assessed. The study includes an overview of Finland's current climate and energy policy framework, mapping of large CO2 emission point sources and identification of possible CO2 transportation and storage alternatives. The future role of CCS in the Finnish energy system is further assessed with energy and emission scenarios created with a comprehensive model called TIMES-Nordic. There are several large CO2 emission sources in Finland that could be potential candidates for CCS, including steel works, power and heat generating plants, as well as oil refineries. In 2008, the 12 largest facilities in the Finnish emission trading registry accounted for 30% of the total CO2 emissions in Finland. Since the Finnish bedrock is not suitable for large-scale geological storage of CO2, captured CO2 would most likely have to be transported to the North Sea or Barents Sea for long-term storage. Most of the largest CO2 emitting facilities are located on the coast line of Finland, which facilitates transportation of CO2 by ship. The current Finnish climate and energy policy largely focuses on increasing the share of renewable energy and nuclear power in energy conversion, which leaves less room for CCS. The preliminary results from the scenario calculations indicate that the share of CO2 mitigation by CCS in Finland would be less than 10 Mt/a CO2 by 2050. However, Finland has also large, stationary CO2 emissions originating from biomass combustion in the pulp and paper industry. When assuming that biogenic CO2 emissions would be included into the emission trading system, the CCS potential rises up to 18 Mt/a CO2 by 2050. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Studies show that energy efficiency should play a significant role towards achieving cost-efficient 100% renewable energy systems. One way to attain cleaner heating solutions for the future is to utilise waste heat from power plants and industry through district heating. In the European Union, approximately 50% of thermal energy is lost in conversion processes. This research paper investigates the potential for the implementation of district heating in a future energy system originally intended not to include district heating. The paper approaches the problem by utilising TIMES modelling to frame the initial future energy system. However, MARKAL/TIMES is not ideal to investigate the operation of different heating scenarios, due to a lack of hourly modelling. Hence, the study utilises EnergyPLAN to investigate the implementation of district heating as an alternative heating scenario to individual heating. EnergyPLAN allows for simulating the hourly operation of not only electricity systems but also heating systems. The study investigates the implementation of district heating in the CO2-80 scenario created with the Irish TIMES model. As the Irish CO2-80 scenario does not include district heating, this study uses EnergyPLAN to simulate an 80% reduction scenario, with and without district heating, to compare the operation of the two systems. A sensitivity analysis is included to reflect on the uncertainties of the study. The results show that a district heating solution is more fuel-efficient while more investment heavy, however the fuel savings more than compensates for the increased investments. In total, the district heating scenario is close to 300 M € cheaper in annual costs than the individual heating scenario for Ireland, and achieves a fuel efficiency increase of 3.5% in the whole energy system due to an efficiency increase in the heating sector. The article shows both the relevance of using multiple models, and the need to consider district heating in a future Irish energy system.},

abstract = {We analyse the impact of the current and an alternative stricter EU CO2 car legislation on transport related CO2 emissions, on the uptake of electric vehicles (EV), on the reduction of oil consumption, and on total energy system costs beyond 2020. We apply a TIMES based energy system model for Europe. Results for 2030 show that a stricter target of 70 g CO2/km for cars could reduce total transport CO2 emissions by 5% and oil dependence by more than 2% compared to the current legislation. The stricter regulatory CO2 car target is met by a deployment of more efficient internal combustion engine cars and higher shares of EV Total system costs increase by less than 1%. The analysis indicates that EV deployment and the decarbonisation of the power system including higher shares of variable renewables can be synergistic. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the deployment of EV would sharply increase between 2020 and 2030 at learning rates above 12.5%, reaching shares above 30% in 2030. Finally, the study highlights that, besides legislating cars, policies for other transport sectors and modes are needed to curb transport related CO2 emission growth by 2030.},

abstract = {The key policy analyzed in this paper, is the achievement of a significant decarbonization of the Greek Energy System by the year 2050 through the decarbonization of the two sectors presently responsible for the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions, namely power and transport. The objective is to reduce GHG emissions by 2050, through the maximization of renewable energy sources (RES) penetration in electricity, with a simultaneous intensive electrification of the transport sector and the electrical interconnection of non-connected islands. An important parameter considered in the present work is that expansion planning of power systems under environmental constraints leads to a rather complex techno-economic analysis involving large scale penetration of Renewable Energy Sources. The penetration level of variable renewable electricity is subject to a number of restrictions implied by the need for (a) storage capacity to decrease the energy curtailment which can occur when the customer load is low and RES electricity generation is high (b) fast reserve capacity to deal with variations of variable RES or combined heat and power (CHP) electricity generation (c) transmission system expansion related to the penetration of areas with high RES potential. New methodologies are developed and a number of novel scenarios are formulated in conformity with the European energy strategy towards 2050.},

abstract = {Many countries have undertaken market-oriented reforms of the power sector over the past four decades. However, the literature has not investigated whether the reforms have contributed to economic growth. This study assesses the potential macroeconomic impacts of following the market-based principle in operating and expanding the power system, an important ingredient of the power sector reform launched in China in 2015. The study uses a hybrid modeling approach by coupling a top-down computable general equilibrium model with a bottom-up energy sector TIMES model. The study finds that electricity prices in China would be 20 percent lower than the country is likely to experience in 2020 if the country follows the market principle to expand and operate the power system. The price reduction would spill over throughout the economy, resulting in an increase in the gross domestic product of more than one percent (or more than a billion US dollars) in 2020. It would also have positive impacts on most economic indicators, including household income and international trade. The findings quantitatively highlight the importance of implementing the 2015 power sector reforms in China and further expanding the initiatives in the future.},

In order to rank possible measures marginal abatement cost curves have become a tool to graphically represent the relationship between abatement costs and emission reduction. This paper demonstrates how to derive marginal abatement cost curves for well-to-wheel GHG emissions of the transport sector considering the full energy provision chain and the interlinkages and interdependencies within the energy system. Presented marginal abatement cost curves visualize substitution effects between measures for different marginal mitigation costs. The analysis makes use of an application of the energy system model generator TIMES for South Africa (TIMES-GEECO). For the example of Gauteng province, this study exemplary shows that the transport sector is not the first sector to address for cost-efficient reduction of GHG emissions. However, the analysis also demonstrates that several options are available to mitigate transport related GHG emissions at comparable low marginal abatement costs. This methodology can be transferred to other economic sectors as well as to other regions in the world to derive cost-efficient GHG reduction strategies.},

This paper describes the methodology used to combine the application of two models in order to provide a basis for informed policy recommendation for GHG mitigation.The TEMT model provides real world emission factors adapted to local conditions in Gauteng for numerous vehicle technology concepts. Those data feed into the TIMES-GEECO energy system model which identifies future technology use for different alternative scenarios. Finally, the scenario results are illustrated spatially using a GIS programme.The results of the scenario analysis show that under implemented policies GHG emissions in Gauteng are likely to increase substantially. Pollutant emissions are currently high as a result of a comparably old vehicle fleet. The spatial display of these results shows where the traffic network is concentrated and the location of so-called emission hot-spots. Energy efficient policies for the transport sector of Gauteng can achieve a significant reduction of emissions and energy consumption. Alternative powertrains and the use of locally produced biofuels can play a significant role in such policies.},

Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide results and directions for future development of the main economic sectors in Taiwan, through analyzing nine long-term (2050) carbon reduction pathways from the technical perspectives. This study utilized the MARKAL energy engineering model to simulate the effects of adopting a combination of technology and tax measures under the various carbon reduction targets and low-carbon development scenarios up to 2050 in Taiwan. The main economic sectors studied include the electricity, industry, household and service, and transportation sectors, while Taiwan's carbon emission reduction targets for 2050 are set as carbon emissions reduced to 50-100% of 2000 levels, or 79-89% below the BAU levels. The study results show that if Taiwan's GDP grows with an annual rate of 3% from 2013 to 2055, and with only limited low/no carbon energy development in place, all sectors in Taiwan need to decrease their energy intensities below the BAU scenario by 48% to 53%, in order for Taiwan to achieve its carbon reduction targets for 2050. However, for all sectors to take up energy saving measures and CCS technologies to reduce energy demand and energy intensity, Taiwan will have to quickly adopt new climate legislation (e.g. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act) and introduce carbon-reduction incentives (e.g., carbon tax). The study results are expected to provide important information for the policy makers in developing Taiwan's long-term low carbon development pathways.},

This paper presents the results on the simulations of different technology development scenarios under the same emission reduction goal, utilizing the MARKAL model to evaluate emissions reduction on Taiwan's electricity, industry, buildings, and transportation sectors. The empirical results show that Taiwan can potentially reduce 56%-60% of greenhouse gas emissions relative to the BAU scenario in 2025, and 15% relative to the 2005 levels. These projected results are higher than the Kyoto targets of Annex I countries and also higher than those projected in the (IEA, 2011 [17]) and (EIA, 2011 [5]) scenarios. The accumulated incremental cost will be an increase by 1.2%-1.96% of Taiwan's GDP. As Taiwan heavily relies on imported energy from foreign sources and has very limited natural endowments of renewable energy, it is very difficult for Taiwan to reach this reduction goal alone through adopting emission reduction technology, or applying economic incentive mechanism. Allowing Taiwan to participate in the international flexible mechanisms will be a necessary measure for Taiwan to achieve its emission reduction goal; in addition, such participation will also benefit the international community's GHG reduction efforts tremendously. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The Committee on Climate Change was appointed in shadow form in March 2008, becoming a statutory committee on 1st December 2008 when the Climate Change Bill became law. Its core function is to recommend what the level of the UKs carbon budgets should be. These budgets are established by the Climate Change Act and will define the maximum level of CO2 and years. The Committee is required to make recommendations on this basis. The Climate Change Act requires the Government to gain Parliaments approval to a proposed level for the next three budgets, setting a trajectory of UK CO2 /GHG emissions over the next 15 This first report of the Committee on Climate Change therefore recommends UK carbon budgets for the three periods 2008-12, 2013-17 and 2018-22. In addition, it covers issues on which we are required to report by the Climate Change Act, or on which we have been asked by the Secretary of State to provide our opinion. These include: What should be the target for UK emissions reduction by 2050? Whether budgets should cover CO 2 including the relevant non- CO2 gases How far CO 2/GHG emissions reduction should be achieved by domestic UK action, and what reliance on emissions reduction credits bought from other countries is acceptable? Whether and how international aviation and shipping should be included in the UKs targets and budgets And the implications of our recommended budgets for economic growth, energy security, the competitiveness of particular industrial sectors, fuel poverty, and for specific regions and devolved administrations. The Committees recommendations on the first of these issues the target for 2050 have already been presented in a letter to the Secretary to State delivered on 7th October 2008. We recommended that the UK should commit to reducing its GHG emissions by at least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Part I of this Report sets out the detailed analysis which underpins that recommendation. Part II sets out our recommendations on the level of the first three budgets and the extent to which these should be addressed via domestic action versus through the purchase of bought-in credits from other countries. Part III explains our proposed approach to international aviation and shipping and to non-CO2 gases, and Part IV covers wider economic and social considerations. The essential task of the Committee can be summed up as providing advice on how fast the UK can and should progress towards a low-carbon economy and how it achieves that progress. In developing that advice, we have had to asses the technologies that are or might be available to deliver low-carbon energy and increased energy efficiency, the potential for consumer behaviour changes that reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, and the likely effectiveness of the policies presently in place or potentially applicable in future. Around each of these there is significant uncertainty. It is not therefore possible, nor is it the role of the Committee, to attempt to predict what the precise path to a low-carbon economy should entail either in terms of technologies or policies. Instead, ourrole is to recommend a path of emissions which is appropriate as a UK contribution to global climate change mitigation, and to identify whether that path is feasible at manageable economic cost, given the range of different technologies and policy levers which could be deployed. This Report therefore sets out alternative ways in which emission reductions could be achieved, and assesses whether there are reasonable scenarios in which different combinations of actions would deliver the required emission reductions path. The analysis clearly shows that the required reduction path is feasible. of the Committee will then be to monitor actual progress in reducing emissions versus the budgets set. We will provide our first progress report to Parliament in September 2009. In addition we will need to provide advice to government on how to fine tune the level of the budgets in the light of the results of the Copenhagen negotiations on a global climate deal. We will also begin work soon on the analysis which will inform our recommendations for the fourth budget period (2023-27) which we will deliver by 2011. And there are a range of specific issues, identified at various points in the Report, where the tight timescales to which we have had to work have allowed only preliminary analysis and where we intend to do more detailed analysis over the coming year. Once the recommendations of this Report have been considered by government and deliberated by Parliament, statutory budgets for the UK emissions of CO2 The progress we have made so far would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the members of the Secretariat and the whole Committee would like to express our thanks to them. /GHG emissions will be set.

In the analysis, the energy-system model generator MARKAL was used to model the electricity and district-heating supply systems in the four Nordic countries Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. It is shown that the introduction of TGC quotas reduces wholesale electricity and TEP prices. The impact on the latter is very pronounced. Retail electricity prices may become lower or higher, depending on the TGC quota, than if obligations to fulfill TGC quotas were absent. The TGC scheme's efficiency in reducing a specific amount of CO2 emissions is also compared to the corresponding efficiency of a TEP scheme involving a broader range of technologies. Furthermore, obligations to fulfill TGC quotas affect investment incentives for new non-renewable electricity supply. This seems especially true for gas-fired power plants. Finally, it is indicated that electricity supply based on biomass combustion dominates the TGC scheme, at least in the short run. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study, we develop a national-scale bottom-up energy optimization model (Pak-TIMES) employing ANSWER-TIMES modeling framework which provides insight into this nexus for Pakistan. The reference energy system of Pak-TIMES model provides energy demand, supply, cost of energy and GHGs emissions. In total, five supply side scenarios enacted in this study are BAU (Business As Usual), RE-30 (30% renewables), RE-40 (40% renewables), Coal-30 (30% Coal) and Coal-40 (40% Coal) for the period 2015–2035. The results suggest that the cumulative investment cost incurred will be 170 billion USD to meet the electricity demand (3091 PJ) by 2035 with 181.5 million tons of GHGs emission in the BAU scenario. The most environmentally ambitious pathway, the RE-40 scenario will require 179.2 billion USD for investment with 96.0 million tons of GHGs emission. The Coal-40 scenario will cause the highest amount of GHGs emissions, i.e., 338.9 million tons with an estimated investment cost of 184.8 billion USD.

abstract = {Over the next decade, large energy investments are required in the UK to meet growing energy service demands and legally binding emission targets under a pioneering policy agenda. These are necessary despite deep mid-term (2025-2030) uncertainties over which national policy makers have little control. We investigate the effect of two critical mid-term uncertainties on optimal near-term investment decisions using a two-stage stochastic energy system model. The results show that where future fossil fuel prices are uncertain: (i) the near term hedging strategy to 2030 differs from any one deterministic fuel price scenario and is structurally dissimilar to a simple 'average' of the deterministic scenarios, and (ii) multiple recourse strategies from 2030 are perturbed by path dependencies caused by hedging investments. Evaluating the uncertainty under a decarbonisation agenda shows that fossil fuel price uncertainty is very expensive at around {\pounds}20 billion. The addition of novel mitigation options reduces the value of fossil fuel price uncertainty to {\pounds}11 billion. Uncertain biomass import availability shows a much lower value of uncertainty at {\pounds}300 million. This paper reveals the complex relationship between the flexibility of the energy system and mitigating the costs of uncertainty due to the path-dependencies caused by the long-life times of both infrastructures and generation technologies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The legally binding UK greenhouse gas emissions targets were in part derived using deterministic variants of UK MARKAL. UCL, under UKERC, has developed a new two- stage stochastic variant, which provides additional near-term insights for policy makers under future uncertainties. Significant uncertainties remain as to the level of effort required by the UK to avoid dangerous warming. In this paper, the use of cumulative CO2 targets, equivalent to 80% and 90% reductions by 2050 allow comparison between current UK policy and the modelled results. Deterministic scenarios result in steep near-term decarbonisation in part due to a social discount rate, proportional to the cumulative target. Under uncertain future cumulative CO2 emission targets, the cost of the hedging strategy is related asymmetrically to the weighting of future scenarios. When the cumulative CO2 targets are equally weighted, the near-term investment strategy lies close to that of the deterministic 90% CO2 target. This indicates that steep near-term decarbonisation is important given exponentially rising cumulative welfare costs with increasingly stringent cumulative emission targets.},

abstract = {In terms of energy resources, Canada is an important player on the world scene. However, the energy systems of the Canadian provinces and territories are much diversified and a national energy strategy is missing in order to optimize the management of energy systems.The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce TIMES-Canada, a new multi-regional energy model that has been developed using the most advanced TIMES optimization modeling framework, while keeping a very high level of details in the database (5000 specific technologies; 400 commodities) compared with other Canadian energy models. Second, we define and analyze possible futures for the Canadian integrated energy system on a 2050 horizon, under five different baselines: a Reference scenario as well as four alternate scenarios corresponding to different oil prices (Low and High) and socio-economic growth trends (Slow and Fast).In our Reference scenario, we show that the Canadian final energy consumption is expected to increase by 43% between 2007 and 2050. The Fast scenario leads to the maximum increase compared with the Reference scenario (21% in 2050). In all scenarios, oil products will continue to dominate on the long term, although in a decreasing proportion over time (from 43% in 2007 to 29% in 2050) in favor of electricity (31% of the additional demand in 2050) and biomass/biofuels. Regarding the corresponding optimal energy production paths, we illustrate two main trends: (1) a gradual replacement of onshore conventional oil & gas sources by unconventional and offshore sources (oil sands is expected to represent half of the production in 2050), and (2) a significant penetration of renewables in the electricity mix is shown after 2035 due to increases in oil import prices and decreases in renewable technology costs. The development and calibration of such a detailed technology-rich model represent an important contribution for Canada: TIMES-Canada is the only optimization model covering in details the large diversity of provincial energy systems on a long term horizon. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our approach consists in deriving minimum cost solutions for achieving progressive emission reductions up to 2050 using the North American TIMES Energy Model (NATEM), a detailed multi-regional and integrated optimization energy model. With this model, we analyze a baseline and two 60% reduction scenarios of combustion related emissions by 2050 from 1990 levels, with different assumptions regarding projected demands for energy services and availability of technology options for carbon mitigation. The first reduction scenario includes only well-known technologies while the second one considers additional disruptive technologies, which are known but are not fully developed commercially. Results show that three fundamental transformations need to occur simultaneously in order to achieve ambitious GHG emission reduction targets: electrification of end-use sectors, decarbonization of electricity generating supply, and efficiency improvements. In particular, our results show that electricity represents between 52% and 57% of final energy consumption by 2050, electricity generating supply achieves nearly complete decarbonization by 2025 and final energy consumption decreases by 20% relative to the baseline by 2050.},

Our analysis relies on the North American TIMES Energy Model (NATEM), which belongs to the MARKAL/TIMES family of models supported by the International Energy Agency. In terms of hydrocarbon exploitation, we consider a recent project proposed by the oil industry for exploiting deposits on Anticosti Island. In our GHG reduction scenarios, the results indicate that the hydrocarbons of Anticosti Island would be exported and thus have virtually no effect on the energy consumption mix in Quebec. This mix would be significantly transformed by the 2050 horizon, through numerous energy efficiency measures yielding reductions in final energy consumption, a massive electrification of end-use sectors, and an increased reliance on bioenergy. However, the 2050 GHG emission levels would increase by nearly 7% in the reference (baseline) case. Greater total GHG reductions would thus be required from the baseline at a significantly higher marginal cost.},

Several analyses have shown that nuclear technologies may represent very attractive options for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, especially in countries with high growth projections for energy demand. Our objective is to analyze the role of nuclear energy in long-term climate scenarios using the World-TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) bottom-up model. World-TIMES is a global model that optimizes the energy system of 15 regions over a 100-year horizon (2000-2100). We present energy and emission results for climate scenarios for two levels of CO2 concentration (450 and 550 ppmv by 2100). We analyze the penetration level of nuclear energy under various sets of assumptions on technology parameters and exogenous constraints on nuclear development to reflect social perceptions. Nuclear energy technologies satisfy a large portion of electricity production in many regions. Most regions experience an energy transition based on advanced oil and gas technologies and hydropower. Other renewable technologies might play a more important role but need further cost reductions or new regulations to penetrate the market in substantial proportions. Carbon sequestration and endogenous demand reductions for energy services are also significantly contributing to reach environmental target. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Afterward, it is possible to calculate their net reduction costs (after permit exchanges) according to different allocation schemes.

Although current energy system models represent various flexibility options, capturing demand-side flexibility and prosumption remains challenging. In light of these challenges, this study presents a national-scale energy system optimization model covering the residential and commercial sectors of Belgium and considering the interplay between local energy use flexibility from electric vehicle (EV) charging, battery storage, rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and distribution grids. To adequately represent energy use flexibility, the model adopts a high temporal resolution, consisting of three representative weeks at an hourly time scale. The role of prosumption is analysed by introducing a prosumer potential reflecting the extent to which local energy production can be used to meet local demand ‘behind the meter'. The results show that flexibility significantly reduces total system costs with reduced distribution grid capacity investment by 48% by 2050. Furthermore, local energy use flexibility enables a significant uptake of rooftop PV (+6.7 GW), but only under a high prosumer potential condition. Finally, a curtailment of around 5–7% of PV production is cost-effective to sustain a more continuous use of the distribution grid at low peak capacity. To increase the robustness of the results, future research should consider expanding the model's sector coverage, adding additional flexibility sources, improving the representation of prosumption, soft-linking with distribution grid models and a better representation of mobility patterns.},

In order to get more grip on planning, we carried out a quantitative scenario study for the electricity and cogeneration sector in the Netherlands using the energy bottom-up model generated with MARKAL. We analysed strategies to realise a 15% and 50% reduction of CO2 emissions in respectively, 2020 and 2050 compared to the 1990 level. We found that, if nuclear energy is excluded as a mitigation option, CCS can be sufficiently cost-effective in 2020 to avoid 29 Mt per year in 2020 in the Dutch electricity sector (which is half of the CO2 emission abatement necessary in this year). We identified the following important factors for planning. In a postponement strategy in which CO2 is reduced from 2020, CO2 can be abated at less than 30 €/t up to 2020. A gradual reduction of 2.5% annually from 2010, asks for a climate policy that makes expenditures possible of 50 €/t CO2 before 2015. Construction of coal-fired power plants without CCS are preferably not built or, in the postponement strategy, only to a limited extent. Finally, early planning is required to realise the construction of a transport infrastructure with a length of around 450 km before 2020. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the concept of applying learning curves in a consistent manner to performance as well as cost variables in order to assess the future development of power plants with CO2 capture. An existing model developed at Carnegie Mellon University, which had provided insight into the potential learning of cost variables in power plants with CO2 capture, is extended with learning curves for several key performance variables, including the overall energy loss in power plants, the energy required for CO2 capture, the CO2 capture ratio (removal efficiency), and the power plant availability. Next, learning rates for both performance and cost parameters were combined with global capacity projections for fossil-fired power plants to estimate future cost and performance of these power plants with and without CO2 capture. The results of global learning are explicitly reported, so that they can be used for other purposes such as in regional bottom-up models. Results of this study show that IGCC with CO2 capture has the largest learning potential, with significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in cost between 2001 and 2050 under the condition that around 3100 GW of combined cycle capacity is installed worldwide. Furthermore, in a scenario with a strict climate policy, mitigation costs in 2030 are 26, 11, 19 €/t (excluding CO2 transport and storage costs) for NGCC, IGCC, and PC power plants with CO2 capture, respectively, compared to 42, 13, and 32 €/t in a scenario with a limited climate policy. Additional results are presented for IGCC, PC, and NGCC plants with and without CO2 capture, and a sensitivity analysis is employed to show the impacts of alternative assumptions on projected learning rates of different systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study provides insight into the feasibility of a CO2 trunkline from the Netherlands to the Utsira formation in the Norwegian part of the North Sea, which is a large geological storage reservoir for CO2. The feasibility is investigated in competition with CO2 storage in onshore and near-offshore sinks in the Netherlands. Least-cost modelling with a MARKAL model in combination with ArcGIS was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the trunkline as part of a Dutch greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy for the Dutch electricity sector and CO2 intensive industry. The results show that under the condition that a CO2 permit price increases from €25 per tCO2 in 2010 to €60 per tCO2 in 2030, and remains at this level up to 2050, CO2 emissions in the Netherlands could reduce with 67% in 2050 compared to 1990, and investment in the Utsira trunkline may be cost-effective from 2020-2030 provided that Belgian and German CO2 is transported and stored via the Netherlands as well. In this case, by 2050 more than 2.1 GtCO2 would have been transported from the Netherlands to the Utsira formation. However, if the Utsira trunkline is not used for transportation of CO2 from Belgium and Germany, it may become cost-effective 10 years later, and less than 1.3 GtCO2 from the Netherlands would have been stored in the Utsira formation by 2050. On the short term, CO2 storage in Dutch fields appears more cost-effective than in the Utsira formation, but as yet there are major uncertainties related to the timing and effective exploitation of the Dutch offshore storage opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

With two distinct modelling approaches we find high projections for future hydropower generation: between 71 and 87 TWh/yr by 2050 in a stringent climate change control scenario in which Ethiopia contributes substantially to global efforts to reach the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement. This elevated level is obtained despite domestic water use and irrigated agriculture water demand expansions, and irrespective of hydrological effects from climate change in terms of a drop in average precipitation nation-wide. This amount of hydro-electricity production matches the expected national hydropower potential. Yet, we encourage authorities to take due account of the large impact that climate change may have on rainfall during particular months or years at individual water reservoirs, which we think should be researched in greater detail. Our combined energy cost-minimisation and hydrological balance analysis shows that our models can be jointly used for the assessment of hydropower as climate change mitigation option, and can assist in the design of policies that integrate the energy and water sectors. Our case study did not yield direct reasons for the Ethiopian government to swiftly stop pursuing its current ambitious national hydropower development plan, but we encourage it to adequately internalise an extensive range of factors – including environmental, geopolitical and social – that may induce it to take a different course.},

We develop scenarios for how public acceptance may constrain the diffusion of CCS, either by reducing the overall amount of installable CCS capacity or by delaying its introduction, and show with an integrated assessment model how the type of limitation in CCS acceptance can critically impact the development of all sectors in the overall energy system over time. We also demonstrate that a reduction or delay in CCS diffusion as a result of critical public opinion can have substantial energy system impacts that differ across not only the nature of acceptance profile but also the sector(s) in which limited public acceptance materializes. Applying a constraint to CCS deployment in both industry and the power sector simultaneously leads to an energy system that is fundamentally different from the one that emerges if the constraint is only applied to the power sector.

This integrated assessment model is utilised to inspect the energy technology requirements for meeting a stringent global climate policy that achieves a stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere with a maximum additional radiative forcing of 2.9W/m2. This climate control target implies a massive deployment of renewable energy in the Middle East, with wind and solar power accounting for approximately 60% of total electricity supply in 2050: 900TWh of an overall level of 1525TWh would be generated from 210GW of installed renewable energy capacity by the middle of the century.

abstract = {This article investigates possible evolution pathways for the transport sector during the 21st century, globally and in Europe, under a climate change control scenario. We attempt to shed light on the question how the transport sector should best be decarbonized. We perform our study with the global bottom-up energy systems model TIAM-ECN, a version of the TIAM model that is broadly used for the purpose of developing energy technology and climate policy scenarios, which we adapted for analyzing in particular the transport sector. Given the global aggregated perspective of TIAM-ECN, that in its current version yields at every point in time a single CO2 price for different forms of energy use across geographic regions and economic sectors, it generates a decarbonization process that for the transport sector occurs later in time than for the power sector. This merely reflects that emission reductions are generally cheaper for electricity production than for transportation, and that it is thus cost-minimizing to spend limited financial resources available for CO2 emissions abatement in the power sector first. In our scenarios the use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines and fuel cells, rather than electricity as energy carrier and batteries to store it, gradually becomes the dominant transport technology. This outcome is in agreement with some recent publications but is at loggerheads with the current popularity of the electric car. Based on sensitivity analysis we conclude that even if the establishment of a hydrogen infrastructure proves about an order of magnitude more costly than modeled in our base case, electricity based transportation only broadly emerges if simultaneously also the costs of electric cars go down by at least 40% with respect to our reference costs. One of the explanations for why the electric car is today, by e.g. entrepreneurs, often considered the supposed winner amongst multiple future transportation options is that the decision horizon of many analysts is no more than a few decades, instead of a full century. Electric cars fit better the current infrastructure than hydrogen fueled vehicles, so that from a short time perspective (covering the next decade or two) investments are not optimally spent by establishing an extensive hydrogen distribution network. Hence the path-dependency created by the present existence of a vast power transmission and distribution network can make electricity the most efficient choice for transportation, but only if the time frame considered is short. Electric transportation generally proves the more expensive alternative in our long-term perspective, except when electric car costs are assumed to drop substantially. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate opportunities for energy technology deployment under climate change mitigation efforts in Latin America. Through several carbon tax and CO2 abatement scenarios until 2050 we analyze what resources and technologies, notably for electricity generation, could be cost-optimal in the energy sector to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in the region. By way of sensitivity test we perform a cross-model comparison study and inspect whether robust conclusions can be drawn across results from different models as well as different types of models (general versus partial equilibrium). Given the abundance of biomass resources in Latin America, they play a large role in energy supply in all scenarios we inspect. This is especially true for stringent climate policy scenarios, for instance because the use of biomass in power plants in combination with CCS can yield negative CO2 emissions. We find that hydropower, which today contributes about 800 TWh to overall power production in Latin America, could be significantly expanded to meet the climate policies we investigate, typically by about 50%, but potentially by as much as 75%. According to all models, electricity generation increases exponentially with a two- to three-fold expansion between 2010 and 2050. We find that in our climate policy scenarios renewable energy overall expands typically at double-digit growth rates annually, but there is substantial spread in model results for specific options such as wind and solar power: the climate policies that we simulate raise wind power in 2050 on average to half the production level that hydropower provides today, while they raise solar power to either a substantially higher or a much lower level than hydropower supplies at present, depending on which model is used. Also for CCS we observe large diversity in model outcomes, which reflects the uncertainties with regard to its future implementation potential as a result of the challenges this CO2 abatement technology experiences. The extent to which different mitigation options can be used in practice varies greatly between countries within Latin America, depending on factors such as resource potentials, economic performance, environmental impacts, and availability of technical expertise. We provide concise assessments of possible deployment opportunities for some low-carbon energy options, for the region at large and with occasional country-level detail in specific cases.},

Many African countries have recently experienced substantial economic growth and aim at fulfilling much of the energy needs associated with continuing along paths of economic expansion by exploiting their large domestic potentials of renewable forms of energy. Important benefits of the abundant renewable energy resources in Africa are that they allow for stimulating economic development, increasing energy access and alleviating poverty, while simultaneously avoiding emissions of greenhouse gases. In this study we analyse what the likely energy demand in Africa could be until 2050, and inspect multiple scenarios for the concomitant levels of greenhouse gas emissions and emission intensities. We use the TIAM-ECN model for our study, which enawbbles detailed energy systems research through a technology-rich cost-minimisation procedure. The results from our analysis fully support an Africa-led effort to substantially enhance the use of the continent's renewable energy potential. But they suggest that the current aim of achieving 300 GW of additional renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030 is perhaps unrealistic, even given high GDP and population growth: we find figures that are close to half this level. On the other hand, we find evidence for leap-frogging opportunities, by which renewable energy options rather than fossil fuels could constitute the cost-optimal solution to fulfil most of Africa's growing energy requirements. An important benefit of leap-frogging is that it avoids an ultimately expensive fossil fuels lock-in that would fix the carbon footprint of the continent until at least the middle of the century.},

abstract = {Because of differences in irradiation levels, it could be more efficient to produce solar electricity and hydrogen in North Africa and import these energy carriers to Europe, rather than generating them at higher costs domestically in Europe. From a global climate change mitigation point of view exploiting such efficiencies can be profitable, since they reduce overall renewable electricity capacity requirements. Yet the construction of this capacity in North Africa would imply costs associated with the infrastructure needed to transport electricity and hydrogen. The ensuing geopolitical dependencies may also raise energy security concerns. With the integrated assessment model TIAM-ECN we quantify the trade-off between costs and benefits emanating from establishing import-export links between Europe and North Africa for electricity and hydrogen. We show that for Europe a net price may have to be paid for exploiting such interlinkages, even while they reduce the domestic investments for renewable electricity capacity needed to implement the EU's Green Deal. For North African countries the potential net benefits thanks to trade revenues may build up to 50 billion €/yr in 2050. Despite fears over costs and security, Europe should seriously consider an energy partnership with North Africa, because trade revenues are likely to lead to positive employment, income, and stability effects in North Africa. Europe can indirectly benefit from such impacts.},

Relatively high agreement exists across models in terms of the aggregated low-carbon energy system cost requirements on the supply side until 2050, which amount to about 50 trillion US$.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the base-year assumptions and baseline projections for the set of models participating in the LAMP and CLIMACAP projects. We present the range in baseline projections for Latin America, and identify key differences between model projections including how these projections compare to historic trends. We find relatively large differences across models in base year assumptions related to population, GDP, energy and CO2 emissions due to the use of different data sources, but also conclude that this does not influence the range of projections. We find that population and GDP projections across models span a broad range, comparable to the range represented by the set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Kaya-factor decomposition indicates that the set of baseline scenarios mirrors trends experienced over the past decades. Emissions in Latin America are projected to rise as a result of GDP and population growth and a minor shift in the energy mix toward fossil fuels. Most scenarios assume a somewhat higher GDP growth than historically observed and continued decline of population growth. Minor changes in energy intensity or energy mix are projected over the next few decades.},

abstract = {We examined the co-evolution of the transportation, and electricity and heat generation sectors in the Netherlands until 2040 using a MARKAL bottom-up cost optimisation model. All scenario variants investigated indicate a switch away from crude oil-based diesel and petrol for transportation. Lowest overall CO2 abatement cost is achieved by accommodating transportation first and using relatively expensive options for emissions reduction in electricity generation if needed. Biomass and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are used to full potential. Transportation CO2 emissions are reduced by switching to ethanol or bio-based synthetic fuels combined with CCS, and series hybrid cars if needed. Depending on the availability of biomass and carbon storage capacity, electricity is produced from biomass, coal with CCS, or wind complemented with natural gas. Indirect greenhouse gas emissions rise to 34-54% of national emissions in 2040. The difference in annual investment required between the scenario variants with and without CO2 emissions reductions of 68% by 2040 is 4-7 billion euro/year, or 0.5-1.2% of projected GDP. Investment costs are mostly determined by the cost of cars and electricity generation capacity. We observe competition for limited biomass supply and CO2 storage capacity between the transportation and power sectors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our analysis of policy scenarios is performed in collaboration with experts, stakeholders and citizens, and facilitated by a newly developed Scenario Interface tool linked to the energy system model TIMES-DK. Market signals, in the form of taxes on CO2 and fossil fuels, retain the highest impact in lowering the carbon emissions from the transport sector, while the promotion of Mobility-as-a-Service is the most cost-effective measure among those analysed. Finally, we discuss the implications of combining instruments into policy packages and emphasise the urgency of addressing technology and policy solutions for the maritime and aviation sectors.},

abstract = {The long-lived dependence on fossil fuels has led to a slow pace in the transition to renewable energy sources in the heavy-duty sectors of the energy system. While bioenergy might represent a possible alternative, biomass is a limited resource, whose use is restricted by potential technical, environmental and social impliations. Because residual biomass inherently minimises these negative impacts, when its sustainable use is ensured, it could lend itself to multiple options, including production of back-up power, heating and alternative transport fuels. This study investigates different pathways for the optimal use of the most abundant residual biomass in Denmark, i.e. straw, from a technical, economic and environmental perspective. We harness the strengths of two bottom-up model typologies by means of soft-linkage to reveal insights from both perspectives: the multi-sectoral model, TIMES-DK, provides a system assessment of the whole energy sector, while the geographically detailed optimization model, Balmorel-OptiFlow, supports the analysis of biorefinery plant size, location and area-specific recovery of excess heat. Modelling results of carbon- and resource-constrained energy scenarios reveal the increased value of straw in a future decarbonised energy system and the attractiveness of the gasification route with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for the production of biofuels to supply the heavy segments of the transport sector. Moreover, relying on current domestic biomass resources would not attain the energy self-sufficiency targets in a carbon-constrained case.},

The paper examines the impacts of the shale gas supply on the U.S. energy security in the short and long-term future and will help guide policy making by identifying the extent to which climate policy can reinforce energy security objectives.The U.S. and other high-income countries face several long-term challenges relating to energy. One is climate change and another, also highly complex and controversial, is energy security. Energy security refers to the robustness, sovereignty, and resilience of energy systems. Energy security and climate policy are frequently presented as two aspects of the same issue. This paper evaluates energy security under long-term energy scenarios and provides analysis to help maintain energy security while meeting other energy challenges. The framework considers vulnerability as a combination of risks associated with energy trade and resilience reflected in diversity of energy sources and technologies. We apply this framework to five scenarios modeled with MARKAL: reference, high shale gas reserves, restricted access to shale gas, CO2 taxes that are equal to Social Costs of Carbon (SCC) and environmental regulation in power sector. Scenarios with high shale reserves and scenario with power sector regulations are associated with lower diversity of energy options. A few risks do emerge under CO2 taxes scenario after 2030 that include potentially high inter-regional trade in natural gas and electricity and low diversity of electricity sources. Net import is lower in the high shale reserves scenario while diversity is higher in a scenario that limits the shale reserves development.},

abstract = {The U.S. economy decarbonization over the next 35 years requires a large transformation of the energy system. The main finding of this study is that it is technically feasible to achieve 80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction below the 2005 levels by 2050 through deployment of existing or near-commercially available technologies. GHG reductions are primarily achieved through high levels of electricity sector decarbonization, electrification of end uses, and exchange of the remaining end-uses to lower carbon fuels such as natural gas. However, deep decarbonization by 2050 triggers very high marginal CO2 reduction costs, unless significant cost reductions of zero and near-zero carbon technologies occur. The results show that CO2 reduction policies accelerate the deployment of renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS) only in the scenarios where the decarbonization policies are more stringent than those in the Clean Power Plan (CPP). Electricity generation mixes in the reference scenarios are largely dependent on the price of natural gas, but also show significant sensitivity to cost reductions in CCS. When increased CCS learning rates are incorporated into the model runs, more CCS is optimal in the medium-term and long-term future in the scenarios with CO2 constraints. An 80% reduction scenario also prompts electrification in end-use demand sectors, creating even more dependence on CO2 management in the electricity generation sector.},

abstract = {On a national level, Sweden has announced plans to have no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2045. Furthermore, Gothenburg, a city in southwestern Sweden, has plans to phase out the use of fossil fuels in its heat and electricity production by 2030. Given that the development of a district heating (DH) system under dynamic and different climate policies and climate goals is a nontrivial problem, this study investigates two different policies of phasing out fossil fuels, either by introducing a fossil fuel ban, or by increasing the carbon tax to phase out the fossil fuel use in 2030 or 2045. The effects of the different phase out strategies on the future development of the existing DH system in Gothenburg has been investigated. The study is based on a system-wide approach covering both the supply and demand side developments. A TIMES cost optimizing energy system model representing the DH system of Gothenburg was developed and applied for calculations. The results show that the total amount of heat supplied by the DH system is unaffected by the phase out policies. The amount of natural gas used to supply the DH system is however dependent on what kind of phase out policy is implemented. A yearly increasing carbon tax policy introduced in 2021 phases out fossil fuel use earlier than the target year, while a ban phases out the fossil fuel only from the actual target year.},

abstract = {As cities expand, new buildings are constructed and they require heating. With increasing integration of the heating and electricity sectors and forecasts of rapid growth in electricity demand, heating choices become critical for the sustainability transition. The main heating options are communal or individual, where the communal option is represented by district heating (DH) and the individual option mainly by heat pumps or biomass heating. Which option is best from the cost perspective depends on the building type and on the energy system development. Thus, this paper investigates cost-efficient heating of new city-level housing in a systems perspective under various scenarios. The investigation was carried out using an energy systems optimization model based on a case representing Swedish conditions. A dynamic approach was used to investigate cost-efficient development of the supply side and demand side simultaneously. The results indicate that the most cost-efficient heating systems are: DH for apartment buildings; and individual heating options for single-family housing with low heat demands. For large single-family housing with high heat demands, the cost-efficient solution depends on the heat demand profile. Higher heat use during winter favors DH and individual biomass boilers, but diminishes the economic feasibility of individual heat pumps.},

For this purpose, the results of the scenario quantification with an energy system model are coupled with multi-criteria sustainability analysis. Two climate protection and one reference scenario are addressed, and the trade-offs between the scenarios are analysed based on a set of 12 interdisciplinary indicators. Implementing a stringent climate policy in Switzerland is associated with co-benefits such as less fossil resource use, less fatalities in severe accidents in the energy sector, less societal conflicts and higher resource autonomy. The availability and implementation of CCS allows for achieving the GHG emission reduction target at lower costs, but at the expense of a more fossil fuel-based energy system.},

abstract = {Singapore has a steady rise in its electricity demand. The Singaporean electricity supply system relies so far heavily on fossil fuels, especially gas and oil, which are both mainly imported from Malaysia and Indonesia. This makes the electricity system in Singapore rather vulnerable to price variations and possible political conflicts with neighbouring countries. A short term solution is the construction of a LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal which opens supply options to many sources in the world. In the long term, renewable energies such as photovoltaics will certainly be introduced into the Singapore's energy system in a more significant way. This paper discusses the possibility to produce substantial amounts of electricity by solar photovoltaics (PV). In addition, the integration of electromobility in Singapore is analysed. Using PV and electric vehicles (EV), the future primary energy demand and CO2 emissions in Singapore could be reduced significantly.

With the assumption of early enhancement and free carbon trading in the cost-optimal enhancing plan, the total cost of global energy system could be reduced by 10% in 2050, compared with the former plan; 4. Under this cost-optimal enhancing plan, developing regions may face great challenges in short to medium term, 122% of additional investment should be put in power sector in 2030, international support on both technology and finance would be essential.},

To achieve global climate mitigation goal, building sector will need to fully tap its potential on energy conservation and CO2 reduction. This paper simulated the transformation pathways of global energy system under 2-degree and 1.5-degree climate targets with Global TIMES model, classified the 14 model regions into high, middle and low income region, and analyzed the main features and key challenges of each region's building sector transition pathways. Modeling results show that: (1) For global building sector, 32 Gt of CO2 emissions reduction is required between 2010 and 2050 by 2-degree target, additional 28 Gt of reduction would be essential to achieve 1.5-degree target; (2) High income region would take the lead in building sector's CO2 mitigation, while low income region may be increasingly important when the carbon constraint gets more stringent; (3) Electrification is a critical approach in building sector's low carbon transition, by 2050, the share of electricity in final energy consumption is expected to reach 44%, 54% and 59% in reference, 2-degree and 1.5-degree scenarios respectively.},

Two national MARKAL-based energy system models of Laos and Thailand were formulated for the study. The results show that 80% exploitation of water resource in Laos would induce power trade between the countries. The integrated energy system cost is found to decrease marginally but it would mitigate the CO2 emission by 2% when compared with the base case. Thailand is expected to gain benefit from the increased level of power imported from Laos in terms of the lower energy system cost, better environmental quality and, greater diversification of energy sources. As compared to the base case, Laos would become the net energy exporter, earn significant export revenue, and improve the increase in revenue of energy export per increase in total energy system cost from the maximum exploitation of hydropower resource. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

All the five countries except Myanmar would benefit from the expansion of regional energy resource integration in terms of lower energy systems costs and better environmental qualities. An imposition of CO2 emission reduction constraint by 5% on each of the study countries from that of the corresponding emissions under the unrestricted energy resource development in the GMS is found to improve energy security, reduce energy import and fossil fuels dependences and increase volume of power trade within the region.

Quantifying the associated system benefits may provide valuable design and policy insights. Yet many existing energy system models are not able to depict various critical features associated with Smart Grids in a single comprehensive framework. These features may for example include grid stability issues in a system with several flexible demand types and storage options to help balance a high penetration of renewable energy. Flexible and accessible tools have the potential to fill this niche. This paper expands on the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). It describes how 'blocks of functionality' may be added to represent variability in electricity generation, a prioritisation of demand types, shifting demand, and storage options. The paper demonstrates the flexibility and ease-of-use of OSeMOSYS with regard to modifications of its code. It may therefore serve as a useful test-bed for new functionality in tools with wide-spread use and larger applications, such as MESSAGE, TIMES, MARKAL, or LEAP. As with the core code of OSeMOSYS, the functional blocks described in this paper are available in the public domain. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Efforts to meet climate change mitigation and energy security targets spur investments in variable renewable energy sources. Their implications for the operation of power plants are frequently investigated drawing on unit commitment and dispatch models. However, the temporal granularity and operational detail these models consider is commonly omitted in the broader family of long-term energy system models. To compensate this short-coming, these two types of tools have sometimes been 'soft-linked' and harmonised for limited simulation years. This paper assesses an alternative approach. We examine an extended version of an open source energy system model (OSeMOSYS), which is able to capture operating reserve and related investment requirements within a single tool. The implications of these model extensions are quantified through comparison with an Irish case study. That case study examined the effects of linking a long-term energy system model (TIMES) with a unit commitment and dispatch model (PLEXOS). It analysed the year 2020 in detail, applying a yearly temporal resolution that is over 700 times higher than in OSeMOSYS. Without increasing temporal resolution (and computational burden) we show that results of the enhanced OSeMOSYS model converge to results of TIMES and PLEXOS: Investment mismatches decrease from 21.4% to 5.0%. The OSeMOSYS analysis was then extended to 2050 to assess the implications of short-term variability on future capacity investment decisions. When variability was ignored, power system investments in 2050 were found to be 14.3% lower. This might imply that energy policies derived from such long-term models - of which there are many - may underestimate the costs of introducing variable renewables and thus meeting climate change or energy security targets.},

abstract = {Background: Climate change poses a dangerous and immediate threat to the health of populations in the UK and worldwide. We aimed to model different scenarios to assess the health co-benefits that result from mitigation actions. Methods: In this modelling study, we combined a detailed techno-economic energy systems model (UK TIMES), air pollutant emission inventories, a sophisticated air pollution model (Community Multi-scale Air Quality), and previously published associations between concentrations and health outcomes. We used four scenarios and focused on the air pollution implications from fine particulate matter (PM 2{\textperiodcentered}5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and ozone. The four scenarios were baseline, which assumed no further climate actions beyond those already achieved and did not meet the UK's Climate Change Act (at least an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2050 compared with 1990) target; nuclear power, which met the Climate Change Act target with a limited increase in nuclear power; low-greenhouse gas, which met the Climate Change Act target without any policy constraint on nuclear build; and a constant scenario that held 2011 air pollutant concentrations constant until 2050. We predicted the health and economic impacts from air pollution for the scenarios until 2050, and the inequalities in exposure across different socioeconomic groups. Findings: NO 2 concentrations declined leading to 4 892 000 life-years saved for the nuclear power scenario and 7 178 000 life-years saved for the low-greenhouse gas scenario from 2011 to 2154. However, the associations that we used might overestimate the effects of NO 2 itself. PM 2{\textperiodcentered}5 concentrations in Great Britain are predicted to decrease between 42% and 44% by 2050 compared with 2011 in the scenarios that met the Climate Change Act targets, especially those from road traffic and off-road machinery. These reductions in PM 2{\textperiodcentered}5 are tempered by a 2035 peak (and subsequent decline) in biomass (wood burning), and by a large, projected increase in future demand for transport leading to potential increases in non-exhaust particulate matter emissions. The potential use of biomass in poorly controlled technologies to meet the Climate Change Act commitments would represent an important missed opportunity (resulting in 472 000 more life-years lost from PM 2{\textperiodcentered}5 in the low-greenhouse gas scenario and 1 122 000 more life-years lost in the nuclear power scenario from PM 2{\textperiodcentered}5 than the baseline scenario). Although substantial overall improvements in absolute amounts of exposure are seen compared with 2011, these outcomes mask the fact that health inequalities seen (in which socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are among the most exposed) are projected to be maintained up to 2050. Interpretation: The modelling infrastructure created will help future researchers explore a wider range of climate policy scenarios, including local, European, and global scenarios. The need to strengthen the links between climate change policy objectives and public health imperatives, and the benefits to societal wellbeing that might result is urgent.

In the less ambitious scenario, instead of imposing a cost of Rand 52/t CO2-eq (at 10% discount rate), reduced costs due to technology learning turn renewables into negative cost option. Our results show that technology learning flips the costs, saving R143. At higher penetration rate, the incremental costs added beyond the base case decline from R92 per ton to R3. Including assumptions about technology learning turns renewable from a higher-cost mitigation option to one close to zero. We conclude that a future world in which global investment in renewables drives down unit costs makes it a much more cost-effective and sustainable mitigation option in South Africa. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article describes the methodology for projecting business-as-usual GHG trajectory developed in technical work for South Africa's Long-Term Mitigation Scenarios (LTMSs), in particular the 'Growth without Constraints' (GWCs) scenario. Technically rigorous projections are important as developing countries define their commitment to act on mitigation relative to business-as-usual (BAU).The key drivers for the GWC scenario include GDP (both growth rate and composition), population, discount rate and technological change. GDP emerged as an important driver in the research for LTMS and further analysis.If South Africa's economy grows without constraints over the next few decades, GHG emissions will continue to escalate, multiplying more than four-fold by mid-century. There is little gain in energy efficiency, and emissions continue to be dominated by energy use and supply, the latter remaining coal-based in GWC. We analyse the projections (not predictions) in relation to various measures.The LTMS GWC scenario is compared to other projections, nationally and internationally. A broadly comparable projection is being used at national level, for electricity planning. When compared to projections from international models, we find that the assumptions about GDP growth rates are a key factor, and suggest that comparisons of global data-sets against national analyses is important. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We review over 70 industrial case studies from widely available published databases, followed by an analysis of the representation of productivity benefits in energy modeling. We propose a method to include productivity benefits in the economic assessment of the potential for energy efficiency improvement. The case-study review suggests that energy efficiency investments can provide a significant boost to overall productivity within industry. If this relationship holds, the description of energy-efficient technologies as opportunities for larger productivity improvements has significant implications for conventional economic assessments. The paper explores the implications this change in perspective on the evaluation of energy-efficient technologies for a study of the iron and steel industry in the US. This examination shows that including productivity benefits explicitly in the modeling parameters would double the cost-effective potential for energy efficiency improvement, compared to an analysis excluding those benefits.

To identify cost effective investment strategies under these uncertainties, a supply and power sector MARKAL model was assembled, following an extensive review of available data on the Cuban power system and resource potentials. Two scenarios were assessed, a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario assuming continued moderate electricity load growth and domestic fuel production growth, and a high growth (HI) scenario assuming rapid electricity demand growth, rapid increase in domestic fuel production, and a transition to market pricing of electricity. Within these two scenarios sets, sensitivity analyses were conducted on a number of variables. The implications of least-cost investment strategies for new capacity builds, investment spending requirements, electricity prices, fuel expenditures, and carbon dioxide emissions for each scenario were assessed. Natural gas was found to be the cost effective fuel for new generation across both scenarios and most sensitivity cases, suggesting that access to natural gas, through increased domestic production and LNG import, is a clear priority for further analysis in the Cuban context. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A preliminary analysis is made of the cost of the renewable system. Net reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases and oxides of nitrogen are also estimated. The analysis suggests that it would be possible to build a sustainable electricity system from the excess natural gas from fracking in less than 30 years. After that, the energy produced from the renewable system is sufficient to replace obsolete equipment and construct new generation technology as required by growth in demand. Even after accounting for the emissions associated with its construction and operation, the sustainable system would reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and nitrogen oxides emissions compared to continued use of a fossil fuel system.},

abstract = {Low-carbon transitions are long-term complex processes that are driven by multiple factors. To provide a theoretical and practical framework of this process, we argue that the combination of the multi-level perspective (MLP) and agent-based modeling (ABM) enables us to reach a deeper and detailed analysis of low-carbon transitions. As an extensively applied theoretical form, MLP conceptualizes low-carbon transitions as a nonlinear process and allows a system to be analyzed and organized into multiple dimensions (landscape, regime, and niche). However, MLP cannot explain the many details of complex transitions, whereas ABM can estimate the influence of interacting behaviors in a complex system. Therefore, the main advantages of the combined approach for the analysis of low-carbon transition are verified: the MLP can contribute to the overall design of ABM, and ABM can provide a dynamic, continuous, and quantitative description of the MLP. To construct this combination framework, this paper offers a guiding principle that combines the two perspectives under a low-carbon transitional background to create an integrated strategy using three procedures: defining the common concepts, their interaction, and their combination. Through the proposed framework, the goal of this work was to reach a better understanding of social system evolution from the present high-carbon state to a low-carbon state under the pressure of ambitious climate goals, providing specific policy recommendations.},

abstract = {Transformation towards climate-neutral energy systems is becoming a challenge worldwide. Most often, strategic planning for the mid- and long-term is tackled with the use of generation expansion optimization models, which have limited capabilities to track in detail power system operation. On the other hand, the unit commitment and economic dispatch models consider many technical constraints but are usually used for short-term planning. The methodological approach presented in this paper aims to improve the planning capabilities by the combination of generation expansion and short-term planning models into one modelling system. Two models were coupled, namely TIMES-PL and MEDUSA, to design a pathway to carbon neutrality in the Polish power system. Three energy scenarios elaborated in this work show that a 95 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the public electricity and district heat production sectors is possible by 2050. The proposed approach improved the robustness of elaborated energy scenarios as in their first versions two of them turned out to be technically infeasible. Detail simulations of the system operation showed that load balancing is possible once 15–20 GW of electrical capacity is installed in dispatchable power generation technologies by 2050 in addition to energy storage and combined heat and power plants.},

A Base case, with a suite of hydrogen policies now in effect or proposed in California (renewable hydrogen mandate, fuel carbon intensity constraint and prohibition on using coal without carbon capture and sequestration) leads to hydrogen fuel with significant reductions in carbon intensity (85% below gasoline on an efficiency-adjusted basis, 75% below on a raw energy basis) and competitive hydrogen costs (∼$4.00/kg in 2025-2050). A number of sensitivity scenarios investigate the cost and emissions implications of altering policy constraints, technology and resource availability, and modeling decisions.

The energy system model for Bhutan was developed under the MARKAL model framework. In Bhutan electricity generation is pre-dominantly hydropower based on run-of-the-river schemes. The model results indicate that a sectoral level policy to promote electric cooking reduces the use of kerosene by 1832 kiloliters and fuelwood by 55 kilotonnes per annum which consequently leads to reductions in the emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx by 17%, 12% and 8% respectively.

abstract = {The electric power industry is the main source of carbon emissions in China. The structural transformation of electric power supply plays a key role in the realization of low-carbon development in China. However, the low-carbon transformation of the electric power structure has to consider the differences in resource endowment and technical conditions among regions. To investigate the potential evolution of the regional electric power supply structure, we collect data of provincial resource endowment and technical differences and introduce them into the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) model of China's regional electric power sector. In this model, different scenarios for carbon emission reduction in the electric power industry are set, and the optimal regional electric power supply structures under each constraint of carbon emissions are calculated. The results show that the electric power supply structure will change in various regions when the carbon emission reduction target increases from 5% (LC1 scenario) to 15% (LC3 scenario). In 2030, the proportion of thermal power in all regions will decline, especially in western China, where the proportion will decline by 8.47%. However, thermal power will still play a leading role in central China and eastern China, with the proportion more than 50%. Meanwhile, the proportion of the power generation of renewable energy in all regions will increase rapidly in the LC3 scenario, especially in western China, where the proportion will account for 60.72% in 2030, while the proportion will account for 27.26% in eastern China in 2030. Wind power will play an important role in the power supply system in the LC3 scenario, and the proportion of wind power in all regions will exceed that of solar power in 2030, especially in northeast China, where the highest proportion of wind power will come to 30.37%.},

abstract = {Transnational municipal networks have led to an increase in the adoption of local energy planning and climate strategies in recent decades. As such, methods are needed to assess local energy systems on a broad scale. This study demonstrates one such approach for Switzerland. Clustering techniques are applied to multidimensional municipal data sets in order to define a set of representative local energy system archetypes for Switzerland. Data includes local energy resource potentials, existing heat and electricity energy demands by sector, and the developed environment classification for approximately 2300 municipalities. Select archetypes are analyzed using a cost optimization model to determine the optimal utilization of local resources and decentralized generation technologies until 2050 under different national energy policy scenarios. Local energy resources provide approximately 40% of municipal heat generation (largely using solar, waste, and wood potentials) and 20% of municipal electricity generation (largely using photovoltaics) by 2050, on average across the modeled archetypes. Urban archetypes demonstrate high rooftop solar and waste potentials and usage rates, while smaller rural and suburban archetypes exhibit relatively high manure, wood and small hydro potentials and usage. Efficiency measures (e.g., renovations) and high CO2 prices are vital to achieving long-term local energy demand and emissions reductions.},

abstract = {This study presents a framework to quantitatively evaluate decentralized generation and storage technology (DGST) performance and policy impacts in a rural setting. The role of DGSTs in the future energy systems planning of a rural agglomeration in Switzerland is examined using a cost optimization modeling approach. Heat and electricity demand for major sectors are considered. Scenarios introduce DGSTs in a stepwise manner to measure incremental impacts on future capacity planning compared to a baseline scenario. Sub-scenarios also examine the impacts of carbon mitigation policies, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out for key energy carriers and conversion technologies. DGSTs enable a significant reduction in electricity grid usage for the community considered. Small hydro with a storage reservoir and photovoltaics enable the community to become largely self-sufficient with over 80% reductions in grid imports by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. Storage enables maximum usage of the available hydro potential which also leads to network upgrade deferrals and a significant increase in photovoltaic installations. Investment decisions in small hydro are robust against cost variations, while heating technology investment decisions are sensitive to oil and grid electricity prices. Carbon pricing policies are found to be effective in mitigating local fossil fuel emissions.},

However, urban policymakers must operate within the constraints imposed by national energy policies. This study aims to understand the impacts of different national energy strategies on long-term urban energy systems planning through a case study for the city of Basel in Switzerland. A cost optimization modeling approach is employed and heat and electricity demand sectors are considered. Energy efficiency measures, particularly building renovations, are found to be cost optimal and enable significant energy demand reductions. Decentralized generation and storage technologies, including rooftop PV, heat pumps, small gas CHPs, and batteries, also provide pathways to reduce emissions and improve energetic self-sufficiency in the long-term. Heat generation using municipal waste provides a cost optimal, low emissions generation pathway as well. Carbon taxes are found to have a significant impact on the uptake of low-emission technologies. The urban environment encourages policymakers to pursue strategies to reduce local CO2 emissions across all national energy policy options evaluated, not only achieving, but also exceeding relative national policy targets in a cost optimal solution.},

abstract = {The future energy development of a country will differ substantially depending on the level of CO2 emission reduction that is aimed at. To properly take the long term risk for drastic CO2 emission reduction targets into account in the analysis of near term energy investment decisions, it is required to apply decision analysis methods that are capable to consider the specific characteristics of climate change (large uncertainties, long term horizon). Such decision analysis methods do exist. They can explicitly include evolving uncertainties, multi-stage decisions, cumulative effects and risk averse attitudes. The methods appear useful to select hedging strategies for CO2 reduction. Hedging strategies for CO2 reduction are sets of near term decisions which are most robust for various long term outcomes of climate change negotiations. The result of a hedging analysis gives a balance between the 'present' risk for costly premature emission reduction (when CO2 reduction appears not needed) and possible 'future' risk for neglected CO2 reduction in the past (when deep CO2 reduction appears to be required). A stochastic version of a dynamic techno-economic energy model for the Netherlands was made. This model was used to quantify a CO2 hedging strategy. Two outcomes of the climate negotiations were forecasted and probabilities were estimated for these outcomes. The results of the examples clearly showed that the calculated near term strategy differs from the results of conventional methods that do not have the capability to include uncertainty. The results of CO2 hedging analyses indicate that it is better to take concrete action than to wait until uncertainty about CO2 reduction targets is resolved.},

The more recent Paris climate agreement has a more ambitious target of limiting the temperature rise to well below 2 °C and the EU ambition is growing to become climate-neutral by 2050. This research explores decarbonization options using an innovative analytical approach that combines energy systems analysis and marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs). System-wide MACCs are derived using scenario ensembles from Irish TIMES energy systems model. Decomposition analysis is then used to associate decarbonization options with carbon abatement costs. In addition, energy systems analysis is carried out on the underlying scenario ensembles that are used to generate the MACCs to capture more technological details and to reflect interactions among technologies. The results show that MACCs are highly dependent on model assumptions and the availabilities of bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies play critical roles. The paper also shows how key mitigation measures can be ranked and classified into categories of resilient (wind energy, CCS, electric vehicles, biofuels), tipping-point (electrifying building heating, biomass plants), and niche (ocean energy) technologies.},

This paper therefore undertakes a whole-system approach and explores optimal pathways towards 100% renewable energy by 2050. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which currently has the highest share of variable renewable electricity on a synchronous power system. Large numbers of scenarios are developed using the Irish TIMES model to address uncertainties. Results show that compared to decarbonization targets, focusing on renewable penetration without considering carbon capture options is significantly less cost effective in carbon mitigation. Alternative assumptions on bioenergy imports and maximum variability in power generation lead to very different energy mixes in bioenergy and electrification levels. All pathways suggest that indigenous bioenergy needs to be fully exploited and the current annual deployment rate of renewable electricity needs a boost. Pathways relying on international bioenergy imports are slightly cheaper and faces less economic and technical challenges. However, given the large future uncertainties, it is recommended that further policy considerations be given to pathways with high electrification levels as they are more robust towards uncertainties.},

However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, ESOMs tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for ESOMs. We have identified four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to ESOM type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights. In the end, we provide a critical appraisal on the use of these methods.},

This study uses a bottom-up energy systems optimization model to assess the cross-sector GHG and criteria air pollutant emissions impacts of a multi-state, medium- and heavy-duty zero emission vehicle mandate in the United States under increasing system-level carbon taxes. It finds that mandating 100% zero emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by 2050 without any tax results in net CO2 emissions benefits, even after considering electric sector emissions. A tax of 100$/tCO2 + 5% per year would reduce CO2 emissions by up to 47% of 2020 levels by 2050.

Quantitative energy modelling exploring alternative long-term decarbonisation pathways can support policy-makers in choosing the most important areas for technology promotion.

The results indicate that only under very favourable conditions, i.e. with learning rates above 15% and high global deployment, marine energy will have a significant contribution to the UK decarbonisation pathway. Alternatively, marine energy could constitute a hedging strategy against multiple failure in other low-carbon options. The early strategic investments into marine energy lead, in most cases, to a slight rise in societal welfare costs compared to the respective cases without attempts to induce marine learning and brings benefits to the electricity system. Thus, on the whole, we conclude that marine energy has the potential to contribute to the UK energy system, but there is a substantial risk that strategic investments in a national lead market will not directly pay off in the long term.},

abstract = {Scenario-based analysis is conducted on the long-term projections of liquid biofuels in China for transport fuels. The key influencing factors during each period are assessed. Driven by the transport energy demand growth, increasing price of crude oil and technological progress, liquid biofuels are expected to develop rapidly in the medium and long term. Meanwhile, it is projected that the utilization of liquid biofuels will be full of uncertainties, with wide range of 45 Million ton of oil equivalent (Mtoe) to 120 Mtoe by 2050. At different times, critical factors significantly differ. In the long term (2030-2050), the development of liquid biofuels is highly dependent on the availability of biomass resources. In the medium term (2020-2030), biomass availability and feedstock price are critical. In the near term (current-2020), the feedstock price of 1.5 generation liquid biofuels is critical. In 2050, the utilization of liquid biofuels can reduce 1-7% of overseas oil dependence ratio, 100-370 million tons of CO2 emission. Market-based instruments, i.e., carbon pricing policy and excise tax preferences, can stimulate the medium- and long-term development of biofuels.

abstract = {Coal is central to China's continued economic growth and CCS is one of the most promising technological solutions to curb the CO2 emitted from the continued use of coal. This paper introduces some areas of recent R&D on CCS in China and focuses, in particular, on the Near Zero Emission Coal (NZEC) project, a China-UK CCS initiative. NZEC is being undertaken in three phases, with the current project comprising the first phase. The ultimate aim of NZEC, following Phase 3, is to have constructed and operated a coal-fired power plant with integral CCS in China. In this paper, some of the early progress made in NZEC Phase 1 is described. Launched in November 2007, the objectives of Phase 1 are to build confidence in CCS and to explore technology options for demonstrating coal-fired power generation with CCS in China. The Phase 1 partnership of nine leading UK organisations and 20 from China demonstrates the strong collaborative working relationship that exists between China and the UK, at all levels, to develop CCS as a key climate change mitigation technology. Apart from NZEC, China is involved in several national and international CCS initiatives and some of these will be touched upon in this paper. The success of the 18-month first phase will, to a large extent, be measured against its contribution to increasing CCS capacity in China and against strengthened links between Chinese and British experts. Activities designed to raise capacity are described. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Norway enjoys an electricity-dominant clean energy system with a high share of hydropower. The power and heating sectors are characterized by high penetration of renewables. But the transportation and offshore industries remain challenging to be decarbonized; therefore, it needs more exploration on cost-effective energy transition strategies. This study develops a long-term energy planning model, TIMES-Hinn{\o}ya, for the Hinn{\o}ya island in Norway and couples it with a detailed electricity system model with hourly time resolution, EnergyPLAN, to overcome the low temporal resolution limitation of the long-term energy planning model. The two models run iteratively. Using the model, five scenarios are designed to investigate the effects of key policy instruments on the energy transition. These scenarios assume the continuation of current climate policies, such as carbon tax on fossil fuels, preferential policies towards purchasing and owning electric vehicles, ban on new internal combustion engine (ICT) cars as of 2025, and the potential incremental carbon tax rate. The results illustrate that although absolute reduction occurs in all the scenarios, the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 can only be achieved by forbidding the sales of new ICE cars, highlighting the importance of zero-emission vehicles in the future transportation system.},

abstract = {Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the most dynamic economic urban agglomerations in China, which has a big proportion of the nation's total energy demand. However, there has not been a systemic simulation into the performance of the GBA's energy system in terms of supply and demand, intensity and security during the on-going energy transition. In this study, we develop GBA-specific TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System), a system-based energy technology model to assess the effectiveness of existing policies on energy system optimization during 2015-2035. We simulate future energy consumption, efficiency, and security of GBA based on the expected changes of energy structure and other socioeconomic factors. Our results show that the energy consumption of the Pearl River Delta and Macao is expected to slowly grow until 2035, while that of Hong Kong would peak around 2025. The coal supply in GBA would decrease by half in 2035 compared to 2015, and the proportion of non-fossil energies would increase to 44%-45% in 2035 to meet the energy demand. Energy intensities of the Pearl River Delta, Hong Kong and Macao are likely to be reduced by 54%, 47%, and 31% by 2035 compared with 2015, respectively. Energy self-sufficiency rate in the GBA would increase from 10% in 2015 to 20-25% in 2035, which could benefit regional energy security. These simulation results show the explicit and long-term dynamics of energy system performances of GBA that are important for taking a more efficient and cleaner approach to energy transition.},

abstract = {In recent decades, exponentially growing water demand, shrinking water resources, and recurring extreme droughts in many regions of the United States have compelled scientists and policymakers to rethink the future of water availability and water management. Since the 1950s, desalination has been applied in many US states as a viable solution to those problems, providing 2. billion gallons per day of desalinated water in 2013 alone. Despite its high production efficiency, flexibility, and reliability in times of drought, in most cases desalination is still not cost competitive compared with water from traditional sources (groundwater and surface water).By means of the SWOT analysis, this chapter identifies and discusses strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges for desalination in the United States. Using examples from California, Florida, and Texas (the leading states on the US desalination market), the chapter demystifies common fears and risks and points out solutions from practice for improving cost efficiency and sustainability of desalination.},

@article{Zongxin2001,
abstract = {This paper summarizes results of an assessment of future energy-technology strategies for China highlighting implications of different advanced energy-technology strategies that could allow China to continue its social and economic development while ensuring national energy-supply security and promoting environmental sustainability. The MARKAL energy-system modeling tool was used to build a model of China's energy system. Different scenarios for the evolution of energy supply and demand from 1995 to 2050 were explored, enabling insights to be gained into different energy development choices that China might make. The overall conclusion from the analysis is that there are plausible energy-technology strategies that would enable China to continue social and economic development through at least the next 50 years while ensuring security of energy supply and improved local and global environmental quality. Surprisingly, except for the case when very major reductions in carbon emissions are sought, the model predicts that such energy strategies would not involve significantly higher cumulative (1995-2050) discounted costs for the energy system than "business-as-usual" strategies. Furthermore, "business-as-usual" strategies, which were also modeled, will not enable China to meet all of its environmental and energy security goals. To meet these goals, an energy development strategy that relies on the introduction of advanced technologies is essential. To realize such strategies, policies are needed in China that will (1) encourage utilization of a wider variety of primary energy sources (especially biomass and wind) and clean secondary energy carriers (especially synthetic fluid fuels from coal and biomass), (2) support the development, demonstration and commercialization of radically new clean energy conversion technologies to ensure that they are commercially available beginning in the next 10 to 20 years, and (3) support aggressive end-use energy efficiency improvement measures. {\textcopyright} 2001 International Energy Initiative, Inc.},

abstract = {This paper discusses methodology of energy system modelling when reduction of local externalities, such as damage to the human health from energy production-related air pollution, is in focus. Ideally, the local energy externalities should be analysed by adopting the impact pathway approach of ExternE study, and following the pollutants from their release to the personal uptake and resulting health effects. This would require inclusion of air pollution modelling and monetary valuation of the impacts into an energy system optimisation process. However, this approach involves a complex study and generalisations are needed. The way local externalities are included in the existing energy system models is identified and discussed in the paper. Only a few studies include localisation aspects when internalising local externalities in an energy system optimisation. The performed analysis of the Danish heat and power sector verifies that it is cheaper for the society to include externalities in the planning of an energy system than to pay for the resulting damages later. Total health costs decrease by around 18% and total system costs decrease by nearly 4% when health externalities are included in the optimisation. Furthermore, including localisation aspects can reduce health costs of the heat and power sector in Denmark by additional 7%. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
